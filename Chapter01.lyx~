A well-balanced line width improves the legibility of the text.
 That's what typography is all about, right?
\end_layout

\end_inset

Many theses, some books, and several other publications have been typeset
 successfully with classic thesis.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Important Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some things of this style might look unusual at first glance, many people
 feel so in the beginning.
 However, all things are intentionally designed to be as they are, especially
 these: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No bold fonts are used.
 Italics or spaced small caps do the job quite well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The size of the text body is intentionally shaped like it is.
 It supports both legibility and allows a reasonable amount of information
 to be on a page.
 And, no: the lines are not too short.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The tables intentionally do not use vertical or double rules.
 See the documentation for the 
\family typewriter
booktabs
\family default
 package for a nice discussion of this topic.

\begin_layout Itemize
And last but not least, to provide the reader with a way easier access to
 page numbers in the table of contents, the page numbers are right behind
 the titles.
 Yes, they are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 neatly aligned at the right side and they are 
\emph on

 necessary.
 If you are still not convinced: is your reader interested in the page number
 or does she want to sum the numbers up? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, please do not break the beauty of the style by changing these
 things unless you really know what you are doing! Please.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Another Important Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the first release of 
\family typewriter
classic\SpecialChar softhyphen
the\SpecialChar softhyphen
sis
\family default
 in 2006, many things have changed in the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 world.
  Trying to keep up-to-date, 
\family typewriter
classicthesis
\family default
 grew and evolved  into many directions, trying to stay stable and be  compatibl
e with its port to \SpecialChar LyX
.
 However, there are still many  remains from older times in the code, many
 dirty workarounds here and  there, and several other things I am absolutely
 not proud of (for  example my unwise combination of 
\size footnotesize
KOMA
\size default
-script and 
\family typewriter
titlesec
\family default
 etc.).

 An outlook into the future of 
\family typewriter
classicthesis
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, I am looking into how to completely re-design and  re-implement
 
\family typewriter
classicthesis
\family default
 making it easier to maintain and use.
 As a general idea, 
\family typewriter
classicthesis.sty
\family default
 should be  distributed separately from the template  itself.
  Excellent spin-offs such as 
\family typewriter
arsclassica
\family default
 could also be  integrated (with permission of their authors) as format
 configurations.
  Also, current trends of 
\family typewriter
microtype
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
fontspec
\family default
, and others  should be included as well.
 As I am not really into deep  \SpecialChar LaTeX
 programming,  I will reach out to the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 community
 for their expertise and help.

Future Work

\begin_layout Standard
So far, this is a quite stable version that served a couple of people well
 during their thesis time.
 However, some things are still not as they should be.
 Proper documentation in the standard format is still missing.
 In the long run, the style should probably be published separately, with
 the template bundle being only an application of the style.
 Alas, there is no time for that at the moment\SpecialChar ldots
 it could be a nice task for
 a small group of \SpecialChar LaTeX
nicians.

Please do not send me email with questions concerning \SpecialChar LaTeX

 But if you have comments, suggestions, or improvements for the style or
 the template in general, do not hesitate to write them on that postcard

The layout of 
\family typewriter
classicthesis.sty
\family default
 can be easily used without the framework of this template.
 A few examples where it was used to typeset an article, a book or a curriculum
 vitae can be found in the folder 
\family typewriter
Examples
\family default
.
 The examples have been tested with 
\family typewriter
latex
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
pdflatex
\family default
 and are easy to compile.
 To encourage you even a more, PDFs built from the sources can be found
 in the same folder.
