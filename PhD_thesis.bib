  abstract = {The geometrical properties of zinc binding sites in a dataset of high quality protein crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank have been examined to identify important differences between zinc sites that are directly involved in catalysis and those that play a structural role. Coordination angles in the zinc primary coordination sphere are compared with ideal values for each coordination geometry, and zinc coordination distances are compared with those in small zinc complexes from the Cambridge Structural Database as a guide of expected trends. We find that distances and angles in the primary coordination sphere are in general close to the expected (or ideal) values. Deviations occur primarily for oxygen coordinating atoms and are found to be mainly due to H-bonding of the oxygen coordinating ligand to protein residues, bidentate binding arrangements, and multi-zinc sites. We find that H-bonding of oxygen containing residues (or water) to zinc bound histidines is almost universal in our dataset and defines the elec-His-Zn motif. Analysis of the stereochemistry shows that carboxyl elec-His-Zn motifs are geometrically rigid, while water elec-His-Zn motifs show the most geometrical variation. As catalytic motifs have a higher proportion of carboxyl elec atoms than structural motifs, they provide a more rigid framework for zinc binding. This is understood biologically, as a small distortion in the zinc position in an enzyme can have serious consequences on the enzymatic reaction. We also analyze the sequence pattern of the zinc ligands and residues that provide elecs, and identify conserved hydrophobic residues in the endopeptidases that also appear to contribute to stabilizing the catalytic zinc site. A zinc binding template in protein crystal structures is derived from these observations.},

Despite its importance, the annotation of zinc-binding proteins in gene banks or protein domain databases still has significant room for improvement. In the present work, we compiled a list of known zinc-binding protein domains and of known zinc-binding sequence motifs (zinc-binding patterns), and then used them jointly to analyze the proteome of 57 different organisms to obtain an overview of zinc usage by archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic organisms. Zinc-binding proteins are an abundant fraction of these proteomes, ranging between 4\% and 10\%. The number of zinc-binding proteins correlates linearly with the total number of proteins encoded by the genome of an organism, but the proportionality constant of Eukaryota (8.8\%) is significantly higher than that observed in Bacteria and Archaea (from 5\% to 6\%). Most of this enrichment is due to the larger portfolio of regulatory proteins in Eukaryota. Keywords:},

  abstract = {Metalloproteins are proteins capable of binding one or more metal ions, which may be required for their biological function, or for regulation of their activities or for structural purposes. Genome sequencing projects have provided a huge number of protein primary sequences, but, even though several different elaborate analyses and annotations have been enabled by a rich and ever-increasing portfolio of bioinformatic tools, metal-binding properties remain difficult to predict as well as to investigate experimentally. Consequently, the present knowledge about metalloproteins is only partial. The present bioinformatic research proposes a strategy to answer the question of how many and which proteins encoded in the human genome may require zinc for their physiological function. This is achieved by a combination of approaches, which include: (i) searching in the proteome for the zinc-binding patterns that, on their turn, are obtained from all available X-ray data; (ii) using libraries of metal-binding protein domains based on multiple sequence alignments of known metalloproteins obtained from the Pfam database; and (iii) mining the annotations of human gene sequences, which are based on any type of information available. It is found that 1684 proteins in the human proteome are independently identified by all three approaches as zinc-proteins, 746 are identified by two, and 777 are identified by only one method. By assuming that all proteins identified by at least two approaches are truly zinc-binding and inspecting the proteins identified by a single method, it can be proposed that ca. 2800 human proteins are potentially zinc-binding in vivo, corresponding to 10\% of the human proteome, with an uncertainty of 400 sequences. Available functional information suggests that the large majority of human zinc-binding proteins are involved in the regulation of gene expression. The most abundant class of zinc-binding proteins in humans is that of zinc-fingers, with Cys 4 and Cys2His2 being the most common types of coordination environment. \textcopyright{} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

In Metal-MACiE, a database of metal-based reaction mechanisms, 116 entries covering 21\% of the metal-dependent enzymes and 70\% of the types of enzyme-catalysed chemical transformations are annotated according to metal function. We used Metal-MACiE to assess the functions performed by metals in biological catalysis and the relative frequencies of different metals in different roles, which can be related to their individual chemical properties and availability in the environment. The overall picture emerging from the overview of Metal-MACiE is that redox-inert metal ions are used in enzymes to stabilize negative charges and to activate substrates by virtue of their Lewis acid properties, whereas redox-active metal ions can be used both as Lewis acids and as redox centres. Magnesium and zinc are by far the most common ions of the first type, while calcium is relatively less used. Magnesium, however, is most often bound to phosphate groups of substrates and interacts with the enzyme only transiently, whereas the other metals are stably bound to the enzyme. The most common metal of the second type is iron, which is prevalent in the catalysis of redox reactions, followed by manganese, cobalt, molybdenum, copper and nickel. The control of the reactivity of redox-active metal ions may involve their association with organic cofactors to form stable units. This occurs sometimes for iron and nickel, and quite often for cobalt and molybdenum. \textcopyright{} 2008 SBIC.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide studies are providing researchers with a potentially complete list of the molecular components present In living systems. It is now evident that several metal ions are essential to life and that metalloproteins, that is, proteins that require a metal ion to perform their physiological function, are widespread in all organisms. However, there is currently a lack of well-established experimental methods aimed at analyzing the complete set of metalloproteins encoded by an organism (the metalloproteome). This information is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the whole of the processes occurring in living systems. Predictive tools must thus be applied to define metalloproteomes. In this Account, we discuss the current progress in the development of bioinformatics methods for the prediction, based solely on protein sequences, of metalloproteins. With these methods, it is possible to scan entire proteomes for metalloproteins, such as zinc proteins or copper proteins, which are identified by the presence of specific metal-binding sites, metal-binding domains, or both. The predicted metalloproteins can be then analyzed to obtain information on their function and evolution. For example, the comparative analysis of the content and usage of different metalloproteins across living organisms can be used to obtain hints on the evolution of metalloproteomes. As case studies, we predicted the content of zinc, nonheme iron, and copper-proteins in a representative set of organisms taken from the three domains of life. The zinc proteome represents about 9\% of the entire proteome in eukaryotes, but it ranges from 5\% to 6\% in prokaryotes, therefore indicating a substantial increase of the number of zinc proteins in higher organisms. In contrast, the number of nonheme iron proteins is relatively constant in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and therefore their relative share diminishes in passing from archaea (about 7\%), to bacteria (about 4\%), to eukaryotes (about 1\%). Copper proteins represent less than 1\% of the proteomes in all the organisms studied. We also discuss the limits of these methods, the approaches used to overcome some of these limits to improve our predictions, and possible future developments in the field of bioinformatics-based investigation of metalloproteins. As a longstanding goal of the biological sciences, the understanding of life at the systems level, or systems biology, is experiencing a rekindling of interest; ready access to complete information on metalloproteomes is crucial to correctly represent the role of metal ions in living organisms. \textcopyright{} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {Zinc is indispensable to all forms of life as it is an essential component of many different proteins involved in a wide range of biological processes. Not differently from other metals, zinc in proteins can play different roles that depend on the features of the metal-binding site. In this work, we describe zinc sites in proteins with known structure by means of three-dimensional templates that can be automatically extracted from PDB files and consist of the protein structure around the metal, including the zinc ligands and the residues in close spatial proximity to the ligands. This definition is devised to intrinsically capture the features of the local protein environment that can affect metal function, and corresponds to what we call a minimal functional site (MFS). We used MFSs to classify all zinc sites whose structures are available in the PDB and combined this classification with functional annotation as available in the literature. We classified 77\% of zinc sites into ten clusters, each grouping zinc sites with structures that are highly similar, and an additional 16\% into seven pseudo-clusters, each grouping zinc sites with structures that are only broadly similar. Sites where zinc plays a structural role are predominant in eight clusters and in two pseudo-clusters, while sites where zinc plays a catalytic role are predominant in two clusters and in five pseudo-clusters. We also analyzed the amino acid composition of the coordination sphere of zinc as a function of its role in the protein, highlighting trends and exceptions. In a period when the number of known zinc proteins is expected to grow further with the increasing awareness of the cellular mechanisms of zinc homeostasis, this classification represents a valuable basis for structure-function studies of zinc proteins, with broad applications in biochemistry, molecular pharmacology and de novo protein design. \textcopyright{} 2011 Andreini et al.},

  abstract = {Zinc is known to be indispensable to growth and development and transmission of the genetic message. It does this through a remarkable mosaic of zinc binding motifs that orchestrate all aspects of metabolism. There are now nearly 200 three dimensional structures for zinc proteins, representing all six classes of enzymes and covering a wide range of phyla and species. These structures provide standards of reference for the identity and nature of zinc ligands in other proteins for which only the primary structure is known. Three primary types of zinc sites are apparent from examination of these structures: structural, catalytic and cocatalytic. The most common amino acids that supply ligands to these sites are His, Glu, Asp and Cys. In catalytic sites zinc generally forms complexes with water and any three nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur donors with His being the predominant amino acid chosen. Water is always a ligand to such sites. Structural zinc sites have four protein ligands and no bound water molecule. Cys is the preferred ligand in such sites. Cocatalytic sites contain two or three metals in close proximity with two of the metals bridged by a side chain moiety of a single amino acid residue, such as Asp, Glu or His and sometimes a water molecule. Asp and His are the preferred amino acids for these sites. No Cys ligands are found in such sites. The scaffolding of the zinc sites is also important to the function and reactivity of the bound metal. The influence of zinc on quaternary protein structure has led to the identification of a fourth type of zinc binding site, protein interface. In this case zinc sites are formed from ligands supplied from amino acid residues residing in the binding surface of two proteins. The resulting zinc site usually has the coordination properties of a catalytic or structural zinc binding site.},

Cellular zinc homeostasis involves the opposing action of two families of metal transporters: the ZnT (SLC30) family that functions to reduce cytoplasmic zinc concentrations and the ZIP (SLC39) family that functions to increase cytoplasmic zinc concentrations. Fluctuations in intracellular zinc levels mediated by these transporter families affect signaling pathways involved in normal cell development, growth, differentiation and death. Consequently, changes in zinc transporter localization and function resulting in zinc dyshomeostasis have pathophysiological effects. Zinc dyshomeostasis has been implicated in the progression of cancer. Here we review recent progress toward understanding the structural basis for zinc transport by ZnT and ZIP family proteins, as well as highlight the roles of zinc as a signaling molecule in physiological conditions and in various cancers. As zinc is emerging as an important signaling molecule in the development and progression of cancer, the ZnT and ZIP transporters that regulate cellular zinc homeostasis are promising candidates for targeted cancer therapy.},

  abstract = {We obtained an extended functional annotation of zinc proteins using a combination of bioinformatic methods. This work was performed using a number of available predicted zinc proteomes of various representative organisms, leading to the almost complete annotation of, among others, the predicted human zinc proteome. The computational tools exploited included sequence-based and, when possible, structure-based functional predictions. We assigned a hypothetical function to 74\% of the 1,472 sequences analyzed that lacked annotation in the starting dataset. We also added new functional categories, not described in the reference dataset, such as ubiquitin binding and DNA replication. As a general conclusion, we can state that the quality of each functional prediction parallels the amount of information for the sequence analyzed: the larger the amount of information, the more detailed and reliable is the proposed functional prediction. Among the findings, we have propose a zinc binding site for archaeal zinc-importing proteins. Furthermore, we propose two groups of transcriptional regulators that are involved in fatty acid metabolism. \textcopyright{} 2010 SBIC.},

Despite this, the chemical fate of the metal in both mammalian and bacterial systems remains poorly understood. Here, we applied a metallomics approach using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and size-exclusion chromatography hyphenated with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SEC-ICP-MS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical fate of silver ions in bacterial culture and cells, and the chemistry associated with these interactions. When silver ions were added to lysogeny broth, silver was exclusively associated with moderately-sized species (\textasciitilde 30 kDa) and bound by thiolate ligands. In two representative bacterial pathogens cultured in lysogeny broth including sub-lethal concentrations of ionic silver, silver was found in cells to be predominantly coordinated by thiolate species. The silver biomacromolecule-binding profile in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was complex, with silver bound by a range of species spanning from 20 kDa to {$>$}1220 kDa. In bacterial cells, silver was nonuniformly colocalised with copper-bound proteins, suggesting that cellular copper processing may, in part, confuse silver for nutrient copper. Notably, in the treated cells, silver was not detected bound to low molecular weight compounds such as glutathione or bacillithiol.},

Using the alkaline microgel electrophoresis assay that detects DNA single-strand breaks and/or alkali-labile sites in individual cells, we evaluated for levels of DNA damage. The mean migration length in control cells was 35.37 {$\pm$} 1.43 {$\mu$}m (8\% damaged cells), whereas the mean migration in cells treated with 0.005 {$\mu$}M CdCl2 for 3 h (acute low dose) was 65.87 {$\pm$} 2.07 {$\mu$}m (88\% damaged cells). Treatment with 0.01 {$\mu$}M CdCl2 for the same time (acute high dose) increased the mean migration length to 125.79 {$\pm$} 2.91 {$\mu$}m(92\% damaged cells). However, a 0.005 {$\mu$}M CdCl2 treatment for 7 days (chronic treatment) only increased 65\% DNA migration to 58.38 {$\pm$} 2.59 {$\mu$}m (88\% damaged nucleus). Lipoperoxidative damage expressed as malondialdehyde (MDA) production per milligram of protein was 15.7 {$\pm$} 2.6 for control cells, whereas in Cd-treated cells the values were 20.2 {$\pm$} 2.4 (acute low dose), 22.9 {$\pm$} 2.2 (acute high dose), and 22.6 {$\pm$} 2.1 (chronic treatment). To study the repair of DNA damage, cells were washed with 0.01 {$\mu$}M meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and fresh Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) added. The percentage of damaged cells diminished after 90 min, with DNA migration returning to control values by 120 min. Cd treatment produced DNA single-strand breaks and the damage was greater in acute high dose treated cells, Lipid peroxidation values did not correlate with DNA single-strand breaks.},

We illustrate these new features with a simple case (HIV-1 reverse transcriptase/inhibitor interaction) and with the more complex case of the folding of a riboswitch triggered by the binding of its ligand. The originality of the new kinITC method lies in its ability to dissect, both thermodynamically and kinetically, the two components: primary ligand binding and subsequent RNA folding. We are not aware of another single method that can yield, in a simple way, such deep insight into a composite process.

The effects of cofactors on the folding reaction have been investigated with {$\alpha$}-lactalbumin as a model protein and metal ions as cofactors. Metal ions accelerate the refolding of {$\alpha$}-lactalbumin by lessening the energy barrier between the molten globule state and the transition state, mainly by decreasing the difference of entropy between the two states. These effects are linked to metal ion binding to the protein in the native state. Hence, relationships between the metal affinities for the intermediate states and those for the native state are observed. Some residual specificity for the calcium ion is still observed in the molten globule state, this specificity getting closer in the transition state to that of the native state. The comparison between kinetic and steady-state data in association with the {$\Phi$} value method indicates the binding of the metal ions on the unfolded state of {$\alpha$}-lactalbumin. Altogether, these results provide insight into cofactor effects on protein folding. They also suggest new possibilities to investigate the presence of residual native structures in the unfolded state of protein and the effects of such structures on the protein folding reaction and on protein stability.},

Given the abundance of halogenated marine natural products found in marine organisms and their potentially important biological activities, the biogenesis of these compounds has intrigued marine natural product chemists for decades. Over a quarter of a century ago, a possible role for haloperoxidase enzymes was first suggested in the biogenesis of certain halogenated marine natural products, although this was long before haloperoxidases were discovered in marine organisms. Since that time, FeHeme- and Vanadium-haloperoxidases (V-HPO) have been discovered in many marine organisms.

In an era where genomic sequence is readily available, deducing genotype\textendash phenotype relationships requires an understanding of protein connectivity at proteome-scale. A proteome-scale map of the protein\textendash protein interaction network provides a global view of cellular organization and function. Here, we discuss a summary of methods for building proteome-scale interactome maps and the current status and implications of mapping achievements. Not only do interactome maps serve as a reference, detailing global cellular function and organization patterns, but they can also reveal the mechanisms altered by disease alleles, highlight the patterns of interaction rewiring across evolution, and help pinpoint biologically and therapeutically relevant proteins. Despite the considerable strides made in proteome-wide mapping, several technical challenges persist. Therefore, future considerations that impact current mapping efforts are also discussed.},

While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.Results: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site.Conclusion: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications. \textcopyright{} 2009 Camacho et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Studies have shown that the catalytic activities of the evolutionarily conserved Mre11-Rad50 (MR) core complex depend on an ATP-dependent global conformational change that takes the macromolecule from an open, extended structure in the absence of ATP to a closed, globular structure when ATP is bound. We have previously identified an additional `partially open' conformation using Luminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (LRET) experiments. Here, a combination of LRET and the molecular docking program HADDOCK was used to further investigate this partially open state and identify three conformations of MR in solution: closed, partially open, and open, which are in addition to the extended, apo conformation. Mutants disrupting specific Mre11-Rad50 interactions within each conformation were used in nuclease activity assays on a variety of DNA substrates to help put the three states into a functional perspective. LRET data collected on MR bound to DNA demonstrate that the three conformations also exist when nuclease substrates are bound. These models were further supported with SAXS data which corroborate the presence of multiple states in solution. Together, the data suggest a mechanism for the nuclease activity of the MR complex along the DNA.},

To reach their functional states, these proteins need to fold into their unique three-dimensional structures in the presence of their cofactors. Two processes, folding of the protein and binding of cofactors, intermingle with each other, making the direct elucidation of the folding mechanism of proteins in the presence of cofactors challenging. Here we use single-molecule atomic force microscopy to directly monitor the folding and cofactor binding dynamics of an engineered metal-binding protein G6-53 at the single-molecule level. Using the mechanical stability of different conformers of G6-53 as sensitive probes, we directly identified different G6-53 conformers (unfolded, apo- and Ni 2+-bound) populated along the folding pathway of G6-53 in the presence of its cofactor Ni 2+. By carrying out single-molecule atomic force microscopy refolding experiments, we monitored kinetic evolution processes of these different conformers. Our results suggested that the majority of G6-53 folds through a binding-after-folding mechanism, whereas a small fraction follows a binding-before-folding pathway. Our study opens an avenue to utilizing force spectroscopy techniques to probe the folding dynamics of proteins in the presence of cofactors at the single-molecule level, and we anticipated that this method can be used to study a wide variety of proteins requiring cofactors for their function. \textcopyright{} 2011 Biophysical Society.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, designed metallopeptides have held the promise for understanding a variety of fundamental questions in metallobiochemistry; however, these dreams have not yet been realized because of a lack of structural data to elaborate the protein scaffolds before metal complexation and the resultant metalated structures which ultimately exist. This is because there are few reports of structural characterization of such systems either in their metalated or nonmetalated forms and no examples where an apo structure and the corresponding metalated peptide assembly have both been defined by X-ray crystallography. Herein we present X-ray structures of two de novo designed parallel three-stranded coiled coils (designed using the heptad repeat (a \textrightarrow{} g)) CSL9C (CS = Coil Ser) and CSL19C in their nonmetalated forms, determined to 1.36 and 2.15 \AA{} resolutions, respectively. Leucines from either position 9 (a site) or 19 (d site) are replaced by cysteine to generate the constructs CSL9C and CSL19C, respectively, yielding thiol-rich pockets at the hydrophobic interior of these peptides, suitable to bind heavy metals such as As(III), Hg(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). We use these structures to understand the inherent structural differences between a and d sites to clarify the basis of the observed differential spectroscopic behavior of metal binding in these types of peptides. Cys side chains of (CSL9C)3 show alternate conformations and are partially preorganized for metal binding, whereas cysteines in (CSL19C)3 are present as a single conformer. Zn(II) ions, which do not coordinate or influence Cys residues at the designed metal sites but are essential for forming X-ray quality crystals, are bound to His and Glu residues at the crystal packing interfaces of both structures. These "apo" structures are used to clarify the changes in metal site organization between metalated As(CSL9C)3 and to speculate on the differential basis of Hg(II) binding in a versus d peptides. Thus, for the first time, one can establish general rules for heavy metal binding to Cys-rich sites in designed proteins which may provide insight for understanding how heavy metals bind to metallochaperones or metalloregulatory proteins. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {The Mg2+-dependent adenylylation of the T4 DNA and RNA ligases was studied in the absence of a DNA substrate using transient optical absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy. The concentrations of Mg2+, ATP, and pyrophosphate were systematically varied, and the results led to the conclusion that the nucleotidyl transfer proceeds according to a two-metal ion mechanism. According to this mechanism, only the di-magnesium-coordinated form Mg2ATP0 reacts with the enzyme forming the covalent complex E-AMP. The reverse reaction (ATP synthesis) occurs between the mono-magnesium-coordinated pyrophosphate form MgP2O72- and the enzyme-MgAMP complex. The nucleotide binding rate decreases in the sequence ATP4- {$>$} MgATP2- {$>$} Mg2ATP0, indicating that the formation of the non-covalent enzyme-nucleotide complex is driven by electrostatic interactions. T4 DNA ligase shows notably higher rates of ATP binding and of subsequent adenylylation compared with RNA ligase, in part because it decreases the Kd of Mg2+ for the enzyme-bound Mg2ATP0 more than 10-fold. To elucidate the role of Mg2+ in the nucleotidyl transfer catalyzed by T4 DNA and RNA ligases, we propose a transition state configuration, in which the catalytic Mg2+ ion coordinates to both reacting nucleophiles: the lysyl moiety of the enzyme that forms the phosphoramidate bond and the {$\alpha$}-{$\beta$}-bridging oxygen of ATP.},

  abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is a highly toxic element due to its high affinity for protein sulfhydryl groups, which upon binding, can destabilize protein structure and decrease enzyme activity. Prokaryotes have evolved enzymatic mechanisms to detoxify inorganic Hg and organic Hg (e.g., MeHg) through the activities of mercuric reductase (MerA) and organomercury lyase (MerB), respectively. Here, the taxonomic distribution and evolution of MerAB was examined in 84,032 archaeal and bacterial genomes, metagenome assembled genomes, and single-cell genomes. Homologs of MerA and MerB were identified in 7.8 and 2.1\% percent of genomes, respectively. MerA was identified in the genomes of 10 archaeal and 28 bacterial phyla previously unknown to code for this functionality. Likewise, MerB was identified in 2 archaeal and 11 bacterial phyla previously unknown to encode this functionality. Surprisingly, homologs of MerB were identified in a number of genomes ({$\sim$}50\% of all MerB-encoding genomes) that did not encode MerA, suggesting alternative mechanisms to detoxify Hg(II) once it is generated in the cytoplasm. Phylogenetic reconstruction of MerA place its origin in thermophilic Thermoprotei (Crenarchaeota), consistent with high levels of Hg(II) in geothermal environments, the natural habitat of this archaeal class. MerB appears to have been recruited to the mer operon relatively recently and likely among a mesophilic ancestor of Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota. This is consistent with the functional dependence of MerB on MerA and the widespread distribution of mesophilic microorganisms that methylate Hg(II) at lower temperature. Collectively, these results expand the taxonomic and ecological distribution of mer-encoded functionalities, and suggest that selection for Hg(II) and MeHg detoxification is dependent not only on the availability and type of mercury compounds in the environment but also the physiological potential of the microbes who inhabit these environments. The expanded diversity and environmental distribution of MerAB identify new targets to prioritize for future research.},

Mercury increased the death rate of macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner when cells were treated with mercury concentrations not causing cell necrosis.

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

In Escherichia coli, this palindrome-mediated inviability results from the activity of the sbcC and sbcD genes, and genetic observations have suggested that they may encode a nuclease. Mutations in these genes also restore the defect in genetic recombination associated with recBC sbcB mutants. Results: We have purified the E. coli SbcCD protein from an overexpressing strain and have shown that it has an ATP-dependent DNA double-strand exonuclease activity. Co-purification of nuclease with protein, antibody inhibition and the absence of activity in extracts lacking the sbcCD genes confirm that the activity is intrinsic to SbcCD. The purified protein also has an ATP-independent single-strand DNA endonuclease activity. Conclusions: We have shown that sbcCD encodes a nuclease. The purified protein has double-strand DNA exonuclease and single-strand DNA endonuclease activities. We propose that SbcCD cleaves secondary structures formed at replication forks and that the broken forks can be repaired by homologous recombination.},

This narrative review examines the efficacy of chromium supplements for improving glycemic control as measured by decreases in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Using systematic search criteria, 20 randomized controlled trials of chromium supplementation in T2DM patients were identified. Clinically meaningful treatment goals were defined as an FPG of {$\geq$}7.2mmol/dL, a decline in HbA1c to {$\leq$}7\%, or a decrease of {$\geq$}0.5\% in HbA1c. In only a few randomized controlled trials did FPG (5 of 20), HbA1c (3 of 14), or both (1 of 14) reach the treatment goals with chromium supplementation. HbA1c declined by {$\geq$}0.5\% in 5 of 14 studies. On the basis of the low strength of existing evidence, chromium supplements have limited effectiveness, and there is little rationale to recommend their use for glycemic control in patients with existing T2DM. Future meta-analyses should include only high-quality studies with similar forms of chromium and comparable inclusion/exclusion criteria to provide scientifically sound recommendations for clinicians.},

We used cryoelectron microscopy to determine a 13-\AA{} resolution structure of a YiiP homolog from Shewanella oneidensis within a lipid bilayer in the absence of Zn 2+. Starting from the X-ray structure in the presence of Zn 2+, we used molecular dynamics flexible fitting to build a model consistent with our map. Comparison of the structures suggests a conformational change that involves pivoting of a transmembrane, fourhelix bundle (M1, M2, M4, and M5) relative to the M3-M6 helix pair. Although accessibility of transport sites in the X-ray model indicates that it represents an outward-facing state, our model is consistent with an inward-facing state, suggesting that the conformational change is relevant to the alternating access mechanism for transport. Molecular dynamics simulation of YiiP in a lipid environment was used to address the feasibility of this conformational change. Association of the C-terminal domains is the same in both states, and we speculate that this association is responsible for stabilizing the dimer that, in turn, may coordinate the rearrangement of the transmembrane helices.},

We have sought to expand the range of computational protein design by developing quantitative design methods for residues of all parts of a protein: the buried core, the solvent exposed surface, and the boundary between core and surface. Our goal is an objective, quantitative design algorithm that is based on the physical properties that determine protein structure and stability and which is not limited to specific folds or motifs. We chose the {$\beta\beta\alpha$} motif typified by the zinc finger DNA binding module to test our design methodology. Using previously published sequence scoring functions developed with a combined experimental and computational approach and the Dead-End Elimination theorem to search for the optimal sequence, we designed 20 out of 28 positions in the test motif. The resulting sequence has less than 40\% homology to any known sequence and does not contain any metal binding sites or cysteine residues. The resulting peptide, pda8d, is highly soluble and monomeric and circular dichroism measurements showed it to be folded with a weakly cooperative thermal unfolding transition. The NMR solution structure of pda8d was solved and shows that it is well-defined with a backbone ensemble rms deviation of 0.55 \AA. Pda8d folds into the desired {$\beta\beta\alpha$} motif with well-defined elements of secondary structure and tertiary organization. Superposition of the pda8d backbone to the design target is excellent, with an atomic rms deviation of 1.04 \AA.},

The catalytic core of MRN/X comprised of the Mre11 nuclease and Rad50 adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) active sites dimerizes through association between the Rad50 ATPase catalytic domains and undergoes extensive conformational changes upon ATP binding. This ATP-bound 'closed' state promotes binding to DNA, tethering DNA ends and ATM activation, but prevents nucleolytic processing of DNA ends, while ATP hydrolysis is essential for Mre11 endonuclease activity at blocked DNA ends. Here we investigate the regulation of ATP hydrolysis as well as the interdependence of the two functional active sites.We find that doublestranded DNA stimulates ATP hydrolysis by hMRN over {$\sim$}20-fold in an end-dependent manner. Using catalytic site mutants to create Rad50 dimers with only one functional ATPase site, we find that both ATPase sites are required for the stimulation by DNA. MRN-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA at sites of protein adducts requires ATP hydrolysis at both sites, as does the stimulation of ATM kinase activity. These observations suggest that symmetrical engagement of the Rad50 catalytic head domains with ATP bound at both sites is important for MRN functions in eukaryotic cells.},

In this work, the characteristics of various metals were studied (Cu, Zn, Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cd and Ca in proteins with known crystal structure) as well as the specificity of their environments. The analysis was performed on two data sets: the set of protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) determined with resolution {$<$}1.5 \AA{} and the set of nonredundant protein structures from the PDB. The former was used to determine the distances between each metal ion and its electron donors and the latter was used to assess the preferred coordination numbers and common combinations of amino-acid residues in the neighbourhood of each metal. Although the metal ions considered predominantly had a valence of two, their preferred coordination number and the type of amino-acid residues that participate in the coordination differed significantly from one metal ion to the next. This study concentrates on finding the specificities of a metal-ion environment, namely the distribution of coordination numbers and the amino-acid residue types that frequently take part in coordination. Furthermore, the correlation between the coordination number and the occurrence of certain amino-acid residues (quartets and triplets) in a metal-ion coordination sphere was analysed. The results obtained are of particular value for the identification and modelling of metal-binding sites in protein structures derived by homology modelling. Knowledge of the geometry and characteristics of the metal-binding sites in metalloproteins of known function can help to more closely determine the biological activity of proteins of unknown function and to aid in design of proteins with specific affinity for certain metals. \textcopyright{} International Union of Crystallography 2008.},

  abstract = {Rubredoxins possess a well-defined mononuclear tetrahedral tetrathiolate metal binding site, a feature exploited by several investigations to study the spectroscopic characteristics and the coordination chemistry of different metal ions at this binding site. In the present work, Hg(II)-substituted rubredoxin (Rd) from Desulfovibrio gigas has been studied by electronic absorption, circular dichroism (CD), magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), and time differential perturbed angular correlation of {$\gamma$}-rays (TDPAC) spectroscopies. The TDPAC spectrum of 199mHg-Rd at pH 8 exhibits a prevailing nuclear quadrupole interaction (NQI) with a precession frequency of {$\omega$}1 = 0.09 Grad/s and an asymmetry parameter {$\eta$} = 0, features characteristic of a slightly distorted tetrahedral tetrathiolate metal coordination, i.e, a HgCysS4 center. In addition, three minor populated NQIs have also been detected. They may represent a trigonal HgS3 ({$\omega$}1 = 1.13 Grad/s, {$\eta$} = 0.21), a digonal HgS2 ({$\omega$}1 = 1.34 Grad/s, {$\eta$} = 0.20), and a digonal Hg(II) coordination ({$\omega$}1 = 1.58 Grad/s, {$\eta$} = 0.18) with unidentified ligands. Since similar studies at pH 2.5 revealed a time-dependent increase of the HgCysS4 population, the low populated sites may represent intermediate Hg(II) complexes formed prior to the generation of the thermodynamically stable structure. The metal-induced absorption envelope of Hg-Rd reveals three distinct transitions with Gaussian-resolved maxima located at 230, 257, and 284 nm, which are paralleled by dichroic features in the corresponding difference CD spectrum of Hg(II)-Rd versus apo-Rd. Based on the optical electronegativity theory of Jorgensen, the lowest energy transition has been attributed to a CysS-Hg(II) charge-transfer excitation. The T(d) type of metal coordination in Hg-Rd is supported by the presence of an unresolved A-term with a negative lobe at 295 nm in the difference MCD spectrum. These results point to the usefulness of optical and TDPAC spectroscopies for studying Hg(II) sites in other proteins.},

We have generated a novel genetic system to study these interactions by taking advantage of the properties of the GAL4 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein is a transcriptional activator required for the expression of genes encoding enzymes of galactose utilization. It consists of two separable and functionally essential domains: an N-terminal domain which binds to specific DNA sequences (UASG); and a C-terminal domain containing acidic regions, which is necessary to activate transcription. We have generated a system of two hybrid proteins containing parts of GAL4: the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to a protein 'X' and a GAL4 activating region fused to a protein 'Y'. If X and Y can form a protein-protein complex and reconstitute proximity of the GAL4 domains, tran-scription of a gene regulated by UASG occurs. We have tested this system using two yeast proteins that are known to interact-SNF1 and SNF4. High transcriptional activity is obtained only when both hybrids are present in a cell. This system may be applicable as a general method to identify proteins that interact with a known protein by the use of a simple galactose selection. \textcopyright{} 1989 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract = {Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination requires resection of 5{${'}$}-termini to generate 3{${'}$}-single-strand DNA tails. Key components of this reaction are exonuclease 1 and the bifunctional endo/exonuclease, Mre11 (refs 2-4). Mre11 endonuclease activity is critical when DSB termini are blocked by bound protein-such as by the DNA end-joining complex, topoisomerases or the meiotic transesterase Spo11 (refs 7-13)-but a specific function for the Mre11 3{${'}$}-5{${'}$} exonuclease activity has remained elusive. Here we use Saccharomyces cerevisiae to reveal a role for the Mre11 exonuclease during the resection of Spo11-linked 5{${'}$}-DNA termini in vivo. We show that the residual resection observed in Exo1-mutant cells is dependent on Mre11, and that both exonuclease activities are required for efficient DSB repair. Previous work has indicated that resection traverses unidirectionally. Using a combination of physical assays for 5{${'}$}-end processing, our results indicate an alternative mechanism involving bidirectional resection. First, Mre11 nicks the strand to be resected up to 300 nucleotides from the 5{${'}$}-terminus of the DSB-much further away than previously assumed. Second, this nick enables resection in a bidirectional manner, using Exo1 in the 5{${'}$}-3{${'}$} direction away from the DSB, and Mre11 in the 3{${'}$}-5{${'}$} direction towards the DSB end. Mre11 exonuclease activity also confers resistance to DNA damage in cycling cells, suggesting that Mre11-catalysed resection may be a general feature of various DNA repair pathways. \textcopyright{} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The Rad50 zinc hook domain mediates zinc-dependent intercomplex associations of MRN, which is important for DNA tethering. Studies in yeast suggest that the Rad50 zinc hook domain is essential for MRN functions, but its role in mammalian cells is not clear. We demonstrated that the human Rad50 hook mutants are severely defective in various DNA damage responses including ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) activation, homologous recombination, sensitivity to IR, and activation of the ATR pathway. By using live cell imaging, we observed that the Rad50 hook mutants fail to be recruited to chromosomal DSBs, suggesting a novel mechanism underlying the severe defects observed for the Rad50 hook mutants. In vitro analysis showed that Zn2+ promotes wild type but not the hook mutant of MR to bind double-stranded DNA. In vivo, the Rad50 hook mutants are defective in being recruited to chromosomal DSBs in both H2AX-proficient and -deficient cells, suggesting that the Rad50 hook mutants are impaired in direct binding to chromosomal DSB ends. We propose that the Rad50 zinc hook domain is important for the initial binding of MRN to DSBs, leading to ATM activation to phosphorylate H2AX, which recruits more MRN to the DSB-flanking chromosomal regions. Our studies reveal a critical role for the Rad50 zinc hook domain in establishing and maintaining MRN recruitment to chromosomal DSBs and suggest an important mechanism of how the Rad50 zinc hook domain contributes to DNA repair and checkpoint activation.},

Here, we describe the activities of the T4 MR complex and its modulation by proteins involved in homologous recombination. T4 Mre11 is a Rad50- and Mn2+-dependent dsDNA exonuclease and ssDNA endonuclease. ATP hydrolysis is required for the removal of multiple nucleotides via dsDNA exonuclease activity but not for the removal of the first nucleotide or for ssDNA endonuclease activity, indicating ATP hydrolysis is only required for repetitive nucleotide removal. By itself, Rad50 is a relatively inefficient ATPase, but the presence of Mre11 and dsDNA increases ATP hydrolysis by 20-fold. The ATP hydrolysis reaction exhibits positive cooperativity with Hill coefficients ranging from 1.4 for Rad50 alone to 2.4 for the Rad50-Mre11-DNA complex. Kinetic assays suggest that approximately four nucleotides are removed per ATP hydrolyzed. Directionality assays indicate that the prevailing activity is a 3{${'}$} to 5{${'}$} dsDNA exonuclease, which is incompatible with the proposed role of MR in the production of 3{${'}$} ssDNA ends. Interestingly, we found that in the presence of a recombination mediator protein (UvsY) and ssDNA-binding protein (gp32), Mre11 is capable of using Mg2+ as a cofactor for its nuclease activity. Additionally, the Mg2+-dependent nuclease activity, activated by UvsY and gp32, results in the formation of endonuclease reaction products. These results suggest that gp32 and UvsY may alter divalent cation preference and facilitate the formation of a 3{${'}$} ssDNA overhang, which is a necessary intermediate for recombination-mediated double-strand break repair. \textcopyright{} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

  abstract = {The Mre11 complex (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) is central to chromosomal maintenance and functions in homologous recombination, telomere maintenance and sister chromatid association. These functions all imply that the linked binding of two DNA substrates occurs, although the molecular basis for this process remains unknown. Here we present a 2.2 \AA{} crystal structure of the Rad50 coiled-coil region that reveals an unexpected dimer interface at the apex of the coiled coils in which pairs of conserved Cys-X-X-Cys motifs form interlocking hooks that bind one Zn2+ ion. Biochemical, X-ray and electron microscopy data indicate that these hooks can join oppositely protruding Rad50 coiled-coil domains to form a flexible bridge of up to 1, 200 \AA. This suggests a function for the long insertion in the Rad50 ABC-ATPase domain. The Rad50 hook is functional, because mutations in this motif confer radiation sensitivity in yeast and disrupt binding at the distant Mre11 nuclease interface. These data support an architectural role for the Rad50 coiled coils in forming metal-mediated bridging complexes between two DNA-binding heads. The resulting assemblies have appropriate lengths and conformational properties to link sister chromatids in homologous recombination and DNA ends in non-homologous end-joining.},

  abstract = {The so-called "Trojan-horse" mechanism, in which nanoparticles are internalized within cells and then release high levels of toxic ions, has been proposed as a behavior in the cellular uptake of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs). While several reports claim to have proved this mechanism by measuring AgNPs and Ag ions (I) in cells, it cannot be fully proven without examining those two components in both intra- and extracellular media. In our study, we found that even though cells take up AgNPs similarly to (microglia (BV-2)) or more rapidly than (astrocyte (ALT)) Ag (I), the ratio of AgNPs to total Ag (AgNPs+Ag (I)) in both cells was lower than that in outside media. It could be explained that H2O2, a major intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), reacts with AgNPs to form more Ag (I). Moreover, the major speciation of Ag (I) in cells was Ag(cysteine) and Ag(cysteine)2, indicating the possible binding of monomer cysteine or vital thiol proteins/peptides to Ag ions. Evidence we found indicates that the Trojan-horse mechanism really exists.},

  abstract = {Background: Information on the occurrence of zinc finger protein motifs in genomes is crucial to the developing field of molecular genome engineering. The knowledge of their target DNA-binding sequences is vital to develop chimeric proteins for targeted genome engineering and site-specific gene correction. There is a need to develop a computational resource of zinc finger proteins (ZFP) to identify the potential binding sites and its location, which reduce the time of in vivo task, and overcome the difficulties in selecting the specific type of zinc finger protein and the target site in the DNA sequence. Description: ZifBASE provides an extensive collection of various natural and engineered ZFP. It uses standard names and a genetic and structural classification scheme to present data retrieved from UniProtKB, GenBank, Protein Data Bank, ModBase, Protein Model Portal and the literature. It also incorporates specialized features of ZFP including finger sequences and positions, number of fingers, physiochemical properties, classes, framework, PubMed citations with links to experimental structures (PDB, if available) and modeled structures of natural zinc finger proteins. ZifBASE provides information on zinc finger proteins (both natural and engineered ones), the number of finger units in each of the zinc finger proteins (with multiple fingers), the synergy between the adjacent fingers and their positions. Additionally, it gives the individual finger sequence and their target DNA site to which it binds for better and clear understanding on the interactions of adjacent fingers. The current version of ZifBASE contains 139 entries of which 89 are engineered ZFPs, containing 3-7F totaling to 296 fingers. There are 50 natural zinc finger protein entries ranging from 2-13F, totaling to 307 fingers. It has sequences and structures from literature, Protein Data Bank, ModBase and Protein Model Portal. The interface is cross linked to other public databases like UniprotKB, PDB, ModBase and Protein Model Portal and PubMed for making it more informative. Conclusion: A database is established to maintain the information of the sequence features, including the class, framework, number of fingers, residues, position, recognition site and physio-chemical properties (molecular weight, isoelectric point) of both natural and engineered zinc finger proteins and dissociation constant of few. ZifBASE can provide more effective and efficient way of accessing the zinc finger protein sequences and their target binding sites with the links to their three-dimensional structures.

Spo11 DSBs form preferentially in nucleosome-depleted regions termed hotspots3,4, yet how Spo11 engages with its DNA substrate to catalyse DNA cleavage is poorly understood. Although most recombination events are initiated by a single Spo11 cut, here we show in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that hyperlocalized, concerted Spo11 DSBs separated by 33 to more than 100 base pairs also form, which we term `double cuts'. Notably, the lengths of double cuts vary with a periodicity of 10.5 base pairs, which is conserved in yeast and mice. This finding suggests a model in which the orientation of adjacent Spo11 molecules is fixed relative to the DNA helix\textemdash a proposal supported by the in vitro DNA-binding properties of the Spo11 core complex. Deep sequencing of meiotic progeny identifies recombination scars that are consistent with repair initiated from gaps generated by adjacent Spo11 DSBs. Collectively, these results revise our present understanding of the mechanics of Spo11-DSB formation and expand on the original concepts of gap repair during meiosis to include DNA gaps that are generated by Spo11 itself.},

Here we report cryo-EM structures of the E. coli Mre11-Rad50 homolog SbcCD in resting and DNA-bound cutting states. In the resting state, Mre11's nuclease is blocked by ATP-Rad50, and the Rad50 coiled coils appear flexible. Upon DNA binding, the two coiled coils zip up into a rod and, together with the Rad50 nucleotide-binding domains, form a clamp around dsDNA. Mre11 moves to the side of Rad50, binds the DNA end, and assembles a DNA cutting channel for the nuclease reactions. The structures reveal how Mre11-Rad50 can detect and process diverse DNA ends and uncover a clamping and gating function for the coiled coils.},

  abstract = {Zinc fingers (ZFs) are among the most structurally diverse protein domains. They interact with nucleic acids, other proteins and lipids to facilitate a multitude of biological processes. Currently, there are more than 10 known classes of ZFs, with various architectures, metal binding modes, functions and reactivity. The versatility, selectivity and stability of these short amino acid sequences is achieved mainly by (i) residues participating in Zn(II) coordination (mostly Cys and His), (ii) hydrophobic core and ZF structure formation, and (iii) variable residues responsible for inter- and intramolecular interactions. Since their discovery, ZFs have been extensively studied in terms of their structure, stability and recognition targets by the application of various methodologies. Studies based on interactions with other metal ions and their complexes have contributed to the understanding of their chemical properties and the discovery of new types of ZF complexes, such as gold fingers or lead fingers. Moreover, due to the presence of nucleophilic thiolates, ZFs are targets for reactive oxygen and nitrogen species as well as alkylating agents. Interactions with many reactive molecules lead to disturb the native Zn(II) coordination site which further result in structural and functional damage of the ZFs. The post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation or nitrosylation frequently affect ZFs function via changes in the protein structure and dynamics. Even though the literature is replete with structural and stability data regarding classical ({$\beta\beta\alpha$}) ZFs, there is still a huge gap in the knowledge on physicochemical properties and reactivity of other ZF types. In this review, metal binding properties of ZFs and stability factors that modulate their functions are reviewed. These include interactions of ZFs with biogenic and toxic metal ions as well as damage occurring upon reaction with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, the methodology used for ZFs characterization, and aspects related to coordination chemistry.},

Here, we present a detailed analysis of the structural and thermodynamic effects governing the formation and stability (log K 12 = 20.74) of this evolutionarily conserved protein assembly. We have dissected the determinants of the stability contributed by the small {$\beta$}-hairpin of the domain surrounding the zinc binding motif and the coiled-coiled regions using peptides of various lengths from 4 to 45 amino acid residues, alanine substitutions and peptide bond-to-ester perturbations. In the studied series of peptides, an {$>$}650 000-fold increase of the formation constant of the dimeric complex arises from favorable enthalpy because of the increased acidity of the cysteine thiols in metal-free form and the structural properties of the dimer. The dependence of the enthalpy on the domain fragment length is partially compensated by the entropic penalty of domain folding, indicating enthalpy-entropy compensation. This study facilitates understanding of the metal-mediated protein-protein interactions in which the metal ion is critical for the tight association of protein subunits.},

The most important characteristics of such a sensor are the molar absorption coefficient and the metal-ligand complex dissociation constant. However, it must be remembered that these values are dependent on the specific experimental conditions (e.g. pH, solvent components, and reactant ratios). If one uses these values to process data obtained in different conditions, the final result can be under- or overestimated. We aimed to establish the spectral properties and the stability of PAR and its complexes accurately with Zn2 +, Cd2 +, Hg2 +, Co2 +, Ni2 +, Cu2 +, Mn2 + and Pb2 + at a multiple pH values. The obtained results account for the presence of different species of metal-PAR complexes in the physiological pH range of 5 to 8 and have been frequently neglected in previous studies. The effective molar absorption coefficient at 492 nm for the ZnHx(PAR)2 complex at pH 7.4 in buffered water solution is 71,500 M- 1 cm- 1, and the dissociation constant of the complex in these conditions is 7.08 \texttimes{} 10- 13 M2. To confirm these values and estimate the range of the dissociation constants of zinc-binding biomolecules that can be measured using PAR, we performed several titrations of zinc finger peptides and zinc chelators. Taken together, our results provide the updated parameters that are applicable to any experiment conducted using inexpensive and commercially available PAR.},

  abstract = {A human fetal hepatic cell line (WRL-68) was used as a model to study the damage produced by mercury. The Hg(II) uptake by WRL-68 cells was found to be in a biphasic manner with a rapid initial uptake phase lasting about 5 min, followed by a sustained phase of slower accumulation. Distribution of mercury was studied and mitochondria were found to be the major target for mercury in this cell line (48\%), followed by nuclei (38\%), cytosol (8\%) and microsomes (7\%). Mitochondrial morphological damage after mercury treatment was observed by transmission electron microscopy. To determine if the toxic effect of mercury on mitochondrial bioenergetics was direct or indirect, mitochondria were isolated from WRL-68 cells after 1 h of pre-incubation with 0.5 {$\mu$}M HgCl2. Oxygen consumption was quantified in two sets of experiments: in the presence of classical mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors; and in the presence of oligomycin. No significant difference was found in respiration with classical inhibitors, indicating that mercury does not affect directly the mitochondrial respiratory chain. However, mitochondria of Hg-treated cells were not inhibited when oligomycin was added, probably due to an uncoupling effect. This effect was prevented with dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment. A possible explanation for mercury's effect on mitochondria and its relation with oxidative stress is presented. \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Each of the seven Zn(II) ions in the Zn3S9 and Zn4S11 clusters of human metallothionein is in a tetrathiolate coordination environment. Yet analysis of Zn(II) association with thionein, the apoprotein, and analysis of Zn(II) dissociation from metallothionein using the fluorescent chelating agents FluoZin-3 and RhodZin-3 reveal at least three classes of sites with affinities that differ by 4 orders of magnitude. Four Zn(II) ions are bound with an apparent average log K of 11.8, and with the methods employed, their binding is indistinguishable. This binding property makes thionein a strong chelating agent. One Zn(II) ion is relatively weakly bound, with a log K of 7.7, making metallothionein a zinc donor in the absence of thionein. The binding data demonstrate that Zn(II) binds with at least four species: Zn4T, Zn5T, Zn6T, and Zn7T. Zn5T and Zn6T bind Zn(II) with a log Kof {$\sim$}10 and are the predominant species at micromolar concentrations of metallothionein in cells. Central to the function of the protein is the reactivity of its cysteine side chains in the absence and presence of Zn(II). Chelating agents, such as physiological ligands with moderate affinities for Zn(II), cause dissociation of Zn(II) ions from metallothionein at pH 7.4 (Zn7T \textrightarrow{$\leftarrow$} Zn7-nT + nZn2+), thereby affecting the reactivity of its thiols. Thus, the rate of thiol oxidation increases in the presence of Zn(II) acceptors but decreases if more free Zn(II) becomes available. Thionein is such an acceptor. It regulates the reactivity and availability of free Zn(II) from metallothionein. At thionein/metallothionein ratios {$>$} 0.75, free Zn(II) ions are below a pZn (-log[Zn2+] tree) of 11.8, and at ratios {$<$} 0.75, relatively large fluctuations of free Zn(II) ions are possible (pZn between 7 and 11). These chemical characteristics match cellular requirements for Zn(II) and suggest how the molecular structures and redox chemistries of metallothionein and thionein determine Zn(II) availability for biological processes. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {The solution and complexation chemistry of zinc ions is the basis for zinc biology. In living organisms, zinc is redox-inert and has only one valence state: Zn(II). Its coordination environment in proteins is limited by oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur donors from the side chains of a few amino acids. In an estimated 10\% of all human proteins, zinc has a catalytic or structural function and remains bound during the lifetime of the protein. However, in other proteins zinc ions bind reversibly with dissociation and association rates commensurate with the requirements in regulation, transport, transfer, sensing, signalling, and storage. In contrast to the extensive knowledge about zinc proteins, the coordination chemistry of the ``mobile'' zinc ions in these processes, i.e. when not bound to proteins, is virtually unexplored and the mechanisms of ligand exchange are poorly understood. Knowledge of the biological inorganic chemistry of zinc ions is essential for understanding its cellular biology and for designing complexes that deliver zinc to proteins and chelating agents that remove zinc from proteins, for detecting zinc ion species by qualitative and quantitative analysis, and for proper planning and execution of experiments involving zinc ions and nanoparticles such as zinc oxide (ZnO). In most investigations, reference is made to zinc or Zn2+ without full appreciation of how biological zinc ions are buffered and how the d-block cation Zn2+ differs from s-block cations such as Ca2+ with regard to significantly higher affinity for ligands, preference for the donor atoms of ligands, and coordination dynamics. Zinc needs to be tightly controlled. The interaction with low molecular weight ligands such as water and inorganic and organic anions is highly relevant to its biology but in contrast to its coordination in proteins has not been discussed in the biochemical literature. From the discussion in this article, it is becoming evident that zinc ion speciation is important in zinc biochemistry and for biological recognition as a variety of low molecular weight zinc complexes have already been implicated in biological processes, e.g. with ATP, glutathione, citrate, ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid, nicotianamine, or bacillithiol.},

They reflect properties of the metal ion and the ligand during their coordination as well as the environment. However, the variation of the M-L distances as a function of the properties of the metal cation and its donor atoms had not been systematically analyzed, and no public website listing the M-L distances from metal complexes was available. Herein, the distances around 63 different types of metal ions in{\~ }200 000 high-resolution crystal structures in the Cambridge Structural Database as well as their preferred coordination geometries have been determined. The dependence of these distances on (i) the donor atom's charge and charge-donating ability, (ii) the donor atom's size, (iii) the metal ion's oxidation state and charge-accepting ability, and (iv) the metal ion's size has also been determined. The concept of ligand coordination number (CN) was introduced to take into account the effect of the number of constituent ligand atoms on the M-L distances in addition to the number of metal-bound ligands. We propose grouping the M-L distances according to both the metal CN and the ligand CN. The mean M-L distance corresponding to a given metal CN and ligand CN was found to be linearly correlated with the metal's ionic radius in going down a main group or in going across the first three rows of the periodic table.

  abstract = {The zinc finger, a motif of protein-nucleic acid recognition broadly conserved among eukaryotes, is a globular minidomain containing a tetrahedral metal-binding site. Preferential coordination of Zn2+ (relative to Co2+) is proposed to reflect differences in ligand-field stabilization energies (LFSEs) due to complete or incomplete occupancy of d orbitals. LFSE predicts that the preference for Zn2+ should be purely enthalpic in accord with calorimetric studies of a high-affinity consensus peptide (CP-1; Blasie, C. A., and Berg, J. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 15068-73). Despite its elegance, the general predominance of LFSE is unclear as (i) the magnitude by which CP-1 prefers Zn2+ is greater than that expected and (ii) the analogous metal ion selectivity of a zinc metalloenzyme (carbonic anhydrase) is driven by changes in entropy rather than enthalpy. Because CP-1 was designed to optimize zinc binding, we have investigated the NMR structure and metal ion selectivity of a natural finger of lower stability derived from human tumor-suppressor protein WT1. Raman spectroscopy suggests that the structure of the WT1 domain is unaffected by interchange of Zn2+ and Co2+. As in CP-1, preferential binding of Zn2+ (relative to Co2+) is driven predominantly by differences in enthalpy, but in this case the enthalpic advantage is less than that predicted by LFSE. A theoretical framework is presented to define the relationship between LFSE and other thermodynamic factors, such as metal ion electroaffinities, enthalpies of hydration, and the topography of the underlying folding landscape. The contribution of environmental coupling to entropy-enthalpy compensation is delineated in a formal thermodynamic cycle. Together, these considerations indicate that LFSE provides an important but incomplete description of the stringency and thermodynamic origin of metal-ion selectivity.},

As a result, deciphering the functional structural biology of the MRN complex is driving novel and integrated technologies to define the dynamic structural biology of protein machinery interacting with DNA. Rad50 promotes dramatic long-range allostery through its coiled-coil and zinc-hook domains. Its ATPase activity drives dynamic transitions between monomeric and dimeric forms that can be modulated with mutants modifying the ATPase rate to control end joining versus resection activities. The biological functions of Mre11's dual endo- and exonuclease activities in repair pathway choice were enigmatic until recently, when they were unveiled by the development of specific nuclease inhibitors. Mre11 dimer flexibility, which may be regulated in cells to control MRN function, suggests new inhibitor design strategies for cancer intervention. Nbs1 has FHA and BRCT domains to bind multiple interaction partners that further regulate MRN. One of them, CtIP, modulates the Mre11 excision activity for homologous recombination repair. Overall, these combined properties suggest novel therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, they collectively help to explain how MRN regulates DNA repair pathway choice with implications for improving the design and analysis of cancer clinical trials that employ DNA damaging agents or target the DNA damage response.},

In these proteins, the Zn(II) ion possesses a multifunctional role as it stabilizes the fold of small zinc fingers, catalyzes essential reactions in enzymes of all six classes, or assists in the formation of biological oligomers. Previously, a number of database surveys have been conducted on zinc proteins to gain broader insights into their rich coordination chemistry. However, many of these surveys suffer from severe flaws and misinterpretations or are otherwise limited. To provide a more comprehensive, up-to-date picture on zinc coordination environments in proteins, zinc containing protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) were analyzed in detail. A statistical analysis in terms of zinc coordinating amino acids, metal-to-ligand bond lengths, coordination number, and structural classification was performed, revealing coordination spheres from classical tetrahedral cysteine/histidine binding sites to more complex binuclear sites with carboxylated lysine residues. According to the results, coordination spheres of hundreds of crystal structures in the PDB could be misinterpreted due to symmetry-related molecules or missing electron densities for ligands. The analysis also revealed increasing average metal-to-ligand bond length as a function of crystallographic resolution, which should be taken into account when interrogating metal ion binding sites. Moreover, one-third of the zinc ions present in crystal structures are artifacts, merely aiding crystal formation and packing with no biological significance. Our analysis provides solid evidence that a minimal stable zinc coordination sphere is made up by four ligands and adopts a tetrahedral coordination geometry. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

MR can recognize and process DNA ends even if they are blocked and misfolded. To reveal its mechanism, we determined the crystal structure of the catalytic head of Thermotoga maritima MR and analyzed ATP-dependent conformational changes. MR adopts an open form with a central Mre11 nuclease dimer and two peripheral Rad50 molecules, a form suited for sensing obstructed breaks. The Mre11 C-terminal helix-loop-helix domain binds Rad50 and attaches flexibly to the nuclease domain, enabling large conformational changes. ATP binding to the two Rad50 subunits induces a rotation of the Mre11 helix-loop-helix and Rad50 coiled-coil domains, creating a clamp conformation with increased DNA-binding activity.

  abstract = {To avoid nonspecific and/or undesirable binding and reactivity of metal ions with cellular components, organisms have evolved metal-specific systems for trafficking proteins. Although systems differ, those handling soft metal ions such as Hg2+, Cu+, Zn2+, etc., all utilize heavy metal-associated (HMA) proteins and domains of {$\sim$}70 amino acids with a conserved GMXCXXC motif in a {$\beta\alpha\beta\beta\alpha\beta$} structural fold. While the conserved cysteines define a common metal binding site in these proteins, other structural features must be utilized to create metal ion, protein partner, and contextual specificities. This paper presents initial structure-function studies of the N-terminal HMA domain (NmerA) of Tn501 mercuric ion reductase (MerA) aimed at identifying structural features critical to its role in facilitating efficient transfer of Hg2+ to the MerA catalytic core for reductive detoxification. First, NMR solution structures of reduced and Hg2+-bound forms of NmerA are presented that allow definition and comparison of the structure of the metal binding loop in the two states. Structural differences between the two forms are compared with differences observed in three HMA domains with different metal ion and functional contexts. Second, analyses of the UV absorbance properties of wild-type, Cys11Ala, and Cys14Ala forms of NmerA are presented that provide assignments of the pKa values for the two cysteine thiols of the metal binding motif. Third, results from 13C NMR studies with wild-type and Y62F NmerA labeled with [{$\beta$}-13C]cysteine are presented that define a role for Tyr62 in modulating the pKa values of the cysteine thiols. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

Previous works have shown that Zn2+ binds preferentially to water molecules and His in catalytic sites, but to Cys- instructural sites, but the molecular basis for the observed ligand preference is unclear. Here, we show that the different Zn2+ roles are also reflected in the different bond distances to Zn2+ in structural and catalytic sites. We reveal the physical basis for the observed differences between structural and catalytic Zn sites: In most catalytic sites, water is found bound to Zn2+ as it transfers the least charge to Zn2+ and is less bulky compared to the protein ligands, enabling Zn2+ to serve as a Lewis acid in catalysis. In most structural sites, however, {$\geq$} 2 Cys- are found bound to Zn2+, as Cys- transfers the most charge to Zn2+ and reduces the Zn charge to such an extent that Zn2+ can no longer act as a Lewis acid; furthermore, steric repulsion among the bulky Cys(S-) prevents Zn2+ from accommodating another ligand. Based on the observed ligand preference and Zn-ligand distance differences between structural and catalytic Zn sites, we present a simple method for distinguishing the two types of sites and for verifying the catalytic role of Zn2+. Finally, we discuss how the physical bases revealed aid in designing potential drug molecules that target Zn proteins. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To understand the basis for interregulation between Mre11 and Rad50, we determined the crystal structure of the Mre11-Rad50-ATPgS complex. Mre11 brings the two Rad50 molecules into close proximity and promotes ATPase activity by (1) holding the coiled-coil arm of Rad50 through its C-terminal domain, (2) stabilizing the signature motif and P loop of Rad50 via its capping domain, and (3) forming a dimer through the nuclease domain. ATP-bound Rad50 negatively regulates the nuclease activity of Mre11 by blocking the active site of Mre11. Hydrolysis of ATP disengages Rad50 molecules, and, concomitantly, the flexible linker that connects the C-terminal domain and the capping domain of Mre11 undergoes substantial conformational change to relocate Rad50 and unmask the active site of Mre11. Our structural and biochemical data provide insights into understanding the interplay between Mre11 and Rad50 to facilitate efficient DNA damage repair.},

To distinguish between these possibilities, we used two methods to create large numbers of DSBs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes, without introducing other substrates for the Mre11 nuclease. Multiple DSBs were created either by expressing the HO endonuclease in strains containing several HO cut sites embedded within randomly dispersed Ty1 elements or by phleomycin treatment. Analysis of resection by single-strand DNA formation in these systems showed no difference between strains containing MRE11 or the mre11-D56N nuclease defective allele, suggesting that the Mre11 nuclease is not involved in the extensive 5{${'}$} to 3{${'}$} resection of DSBs.

Partially (surface) oxidized silver nanoparticles have antibacterial activities, but zero-valent nanoparticles do not. The levels of chemisorbed Ag+ that form on the particle's surface, as revealed by changes in the surface plasmon resonance absorption during oxidation and reduction, correlate well with the observed antibacterial activities. Silver nanoparticles, like Ag+ in the form of AgNO3 solution, are tolerated by the bacteria strains resistant to Ag+. The antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles are related to their size, with the smaller particles having higher activities on the basis of equivalent silver mass content. The silver nanoparticles aggregate in media with a high electrolyte content, resulting in a loss of antibacterial activities. However, complexation with albumin can stabilize the silver nanoparticles against aggregation, leading to a retention of the antibacterial activities. Taken together, the results show that the antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles are dependent on chemisorbed Ag+, which is readily formed owing to extreme sensitivity to oxygen. The antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles are dependent on optimally displayed oxidized surfaces, which are present in well-dispersed suspensions. \textcopyright{} 2007 SBIC.},

RAD50-MRE11 has an extended conformation in solution when MRE11 is an active nuclease. However, ATP binding to RAD50 induces a closed conformation, and in this state MRE11 is an endonuclease. ATP hydrolysis opens the RAD50-MRE11 complex, and MRE11 maintains exonuclease activity. Thus, ATP hydrolysis is a molecular switch that converts MRE11 from an endonuclease to an exonuclease. We propose a testable model in which the open-closed transitions are used by RAD50-MRE11 to discriminate among DNA ends and drive the choice of recombination pathways.},

This production leads to an increasing human exposure to silver in different forms. Indeed, AgNPs are subject to various transformations in aqueous aerobic conditions that trigger the production of Ag(I) species. The main environmental transformation produces the non-toxic species silver sulfide. Transformations occurring in mammals are more diverse and mainly depend on the interaction of AgNPs with thiol, chloride and proteins. Any of these species have a different impact on AgNPs and induces AgNP dissolution into Ag(I) species, aggregation and/or stabilization. The transformations occurring also depend on the exposure route. The main one is dietary but medical exposure is also growing with the massive use of nanosilver as biocide in medical devices. For the former, AgNP modifications and Ag distribution has been extensively studied using in vitro and in vivo models, while data related to medical use of nanosilver are scarce. However, most of the in vitro and in vivo data often remain inconsistent. In this review, we describe both in vitro, in cellulo and in vivo data about AgNP transformations, silver speciation and biodistribution. We try to reconcile all these data and describe the latest methods for the future studies of AgNP fate in mammals.},

The regulatory functions of zinc ions, together with their functions as a cofactor in about three thousand zinc metalloproteins, impact virtually all aspects of cell biology. This article attempts to define the regulatory functions of zinc ions, and focuses on the nature of zinc signals and zinc signalling in pathways where zinc ions are either extracellular stimuli or intracellular messengers. These pathways interact with Ca2+, redox, and phosphorylation signalling. The regulatory functions of zinc require a complex system of precise homeostatic control for transients, subcellular distribution and traffic, organellar homeostasis, and vesicular storage and exocytosis of zinc ions.},

Although biochemical studies have elucidated several aspects of the NHEJ reaction mechanism, much less is known about NHEJ in living cells, mainly because of the inability to visualize NHEJ repair proteins at DNA damage. Here we provide evidence that a pulsed near IR laser can produce DSBs without any visible alterations in the nucleus, and we show that NHEJ proteins accumulate in the irradiated areas. The levels of DSBs and Ku accumulation diminished in time, showing that this approach allows us to study DNA repair kinetics in vivo. Remarkably, the Ku heterodimers on DNA ends were in dynamic equilibrium with Ku70/80 in solution, showing that NHEJ complex assembly is reversible. Accumulation of XRCC4/ligase IV on DSBs depended on the presence of Ku70/80, but not DNA-PKcs. We detected a direct interaction between Ku70 and XRCC4 that could explain these requirements. Our results suggest that this assembly constitutes the core of the NHEJ reaction and that XRCC4 may serve as a flexible tether between Ku70/80 and ligase IV. \textcopyright{} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

We show here that Fis subunits rapidly exchange between dimers in solution by disulfide cross-linking mixtures of Fis mutants with different electrophoretic mobilities and by monitoring energy transfer between fluorescently labeled Fis subunits upon heterodimer formation. The effects of detergents and salt concentrations on subunit exchange imply that the dimer is predominantly stabilized by hydrophobic forces, consistent with the X-ray crystal structures. Specific and nonspecific DNA strongly inhibit Fis subunit exchange. In all crystal forms of Fis, the separation between the DNA recognition helices within the Fis dimer is too short to insert into adjacent major grooves on canonical B-DNA, implying that conformational changes within the Fis dimer and/or the DNA must occur upon binding. We therefore investigated the functional importance of dimer interface flexibility for Fis-DNA binding by studying the DNA binding properties of Fis mutants that were cross-linked at different positions in the dimer. Flexibility within the core dimer interface does not appear to be required for efficient DNA binding, Fis-DNA complex dissociation, or Fis-induced DNA bending. Moreover, FRET-based experiments provided no evidence for a change in the spatial relationship between the two helix-turn-helix motifs in the Fis dimer upon DNA binding. These results support a model in which the unusually short distance between DNA recognition helices on Fis is accommodated primarily through bending of the DNA.},

This process is poorly understood in eukaryotes, but several factors have been implicated, including the Mre11 complex (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/NBS1), Sae2/CtIP/Ctp1 and Exo1. Here we demonstrate that yeast Exo1 nuclease and Sgs1 helicase function in alternative pathways for DSB processing. Novel, partially resected intermediates accumulate in a double mutant lacking Exo1 and Sgs1, which are poor substrates for homologous recombination. The early processing step that generates partly resected intermediates is dependent on Sae2. When Sae2 is absent, in addition to Exo1 and Sgs1, unprocessed DSBs accumulate and homology-dependent repair fails. These results suggest a two-step mechanism for DSB processing during homologous recombination. First, the Mre11 complex and Sae2 remove a small oligonucleotide(s) from the DNA ends to form an early intermediate. Second, Exo1 and/or Sgs1 rapidly process this intermediate to generate extensive tracts of single-stranded DNA that serve as substrate for Rad51. \textcopyright 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The Mre11:Rad50 (MR) complex is an evolutionarily conserved complex of two Rad50 ATPases and a dimer of the Mre11 nuclease that senses and processes DSBs and tethers DNA for repair. ATP binding and hydrolysis by Rad50 is functionally coupled to DNA-binding and tethering, but also regulates Mre11's nuclease in processing DNA ends. To understand how ATP controls the interaction between Mre11 and Rad50, we determined the crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima (Tm) MR trapped in an ATP/ADP state. ATP binding to Rad50 induces a large structural change from an open form with accessible Mre11 nuclease sites into a closed form. Remarkably, the NBD dimer binds in the Mre11 DNA-binding cleft blocking Mre11's dsDNA-binding sites. An accompanying large swivel of the Rad50 coiled coil domains appears to prepare the coiled coils for DNA tethering. DNA-binding studies show that within the complex, Rad50 likely forms a dsDNA-binding site in response to ATP, while the Mre11 nuclease module retains a ssDNA-binding site.

  abstract = {The repair of double-strand breaks in DNA is an essential process in all organisms, and requires the coordinated activities of evolutionarily conserved protein assemblies. One of the most critical of these is the Mre11/Rad50 (M/R) complex, which is present in all three biological kingdoms, but is not well-understood at the biochemical level. Previous structural analysis of a Rad50 homolog from archaebacteria illuminated the catalytic core of the enzyme, an ATP-binding domain related to the ABC transporter family of ATPases. Here, we present the crystallographic structure of the Rad50 mutant S793R. This missense signature motif mutation changes the key serine residue in the signature motif that is conserved among Rad50 homologs and ABC ATPases. The S793R mutation is analogous to the mutation S549R in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that results in cystic fibrosis. We show here that the serine to arginine change in the Rad50 protein prevents ATP binding and disrupts the communication among the other ATP-binding loops. This structural change, in turn, alters the communication between Rad50 monomers and thus prevents Rad50 dimerization. The equivalent mutation was made in the human Rad50 gene, and the resulting mutant protein did form a complex with Mre11 and Nbs1, but was specifically deficient in all ATP-dependent enzymatic activities. This signature motif structure-function homology extends to yeast, because the same mutation introduced into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD50 gene generated an allele that failed to complement a rad50 deletion strain in DNA repair assays in vivo. These structural and biochemical results extend our understanding of the Rad50 catalytic domain and validate the use of the signature motif mutant to test the role of Rad50 ATP binding in diverse organisms. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Type II DNA topoisomerase enzymes (TOP2) catalyze topological changes by strand passage reactions. They involve passing one intact double stranded DNA duplex through a transient enzyme-bridged break in another (gated helix) followed by ligation of the break by TOP2. A TOP2 poison, etoposide blocks TOP2 catalysis at the ligation step of the enzyme-bridged break, increasing the number of stable TOP2 cleavage complexes (TOP2ccs). Remarkably, such pathological TOP2ccs are formed during the normal cell cycle as well as in postmitotic cells. Thus, this `abortive catalysis' can be a major source of spontaneously arising DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). TOP2-mediated DSBs are also formed upon stimulation with physiological concentrations of androgens and estrogens. The frequent occurrence of TOP2-mediated DSBs was previously not appreciated because they are efficiently repaired. This repair is performed in collaboration with BRCA1, BRCA2, MRE11 nuclease, and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) with nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) factors. This review first discusses spontaneously arising DSBs caused by the abortive catalysis of TOP2 and then summarizes proteins involved in repairing stalled TOP2ccs and discusses the genotoxicity of the sex hormones.},

The various biological roles of proteins include, but are not limited to, signal transduction, gene transcription, cell death, immune function, structural support, and catalysis of all the chemical reactions that enable organisms to survive. The varied roles of proteins have led to them being dubbed `the workhorses of all living organisms'. This article discusses the functions of proteins and how protein function is studied in a laboratory setting. In this article, we begin by examining the functions of protein domains, followed by a discussion of some of the major classes of proteins based on their function. We consider protein binding in detail, which is central to protein function. We then examine how protein function can be altered through various mechanisms including post-translational modification, and changes to environment, oligomerisation and mutations. Finally, we consider a handful of the techniques employed in the laboratory to understand and measure the function of proteins.},

Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) and Ku70-Ku80 (Ku) direct distinct DSB repair pathways, but the interplay between these complexes at a DSB remains unclear. Here, we use high-throughput single-molecule microscopy to show that MRN searches for free DNA ends by one-dimensional facilitated diffusion, even on nucleosome-coated DNA. Rad50 binds homoduplex DNA and promotes facilitated diffusion, whereas Mre11 is required for DNA end recognition and nuclease activities. MRN gains access to occluded DNA ends by removing Ku or other DNA adducts via an Mre11-dependent nucleolytic reaction. Next, MRN loads exonuclease 1 (Exo1) onto the free DNA ends to initiate DNA resection. In the presence of replication protein A (RPA), MRN acts as a processivity factor for Exo1, retaining the exonuclease on DNA for long-range resection. Our results provide a mechanism for how MRN promotes homologous recombination on nucleosome-coated DNA.},

MRE11 possesses dual 3{${'}-$}5{${'}$} exonuclease and endonuclease activity and forms the core of the multifunctional MRN complex. We previously identified a C-terminally truncated form of MRE11 (TR-MRE11) associated with post-translational MRE11 degradation. Here we identified SPRTN as the essential protease for the formation of TR-MRE11 and characterised the role of this MRE11 form in its DNA damage response (DDR). Using tandem mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis, the SPRTN-dependent cleavage site for MRE11 was identified between 559 and 580 amino acids. Despite the intact interaction of TR-MRE11 with its constitutive core complex proteins RAD50 and NBS1, both nuclease activities of truncated MRE11 were dramatically reduced due to its deficient binding to DNA. Furthermore, lack of the MRE11 C-terminal decreased HR repair efficiency, very likely due to abolished recruitment of TR-MRE11 to the sites of DNA damage, which consequently led to increased cellular radiosensitivity. The presence of this DNA repair-defective TR-MRE11 could explain our previous finding that the high MRE11 protein expression by immunohistochemistry correlates with improved survival following radical radiotherapy in bladder cancer patients.},

The relationship between Tm and 1n [Na +] was nonlinear over this range of sodium ion concentrations, and the observed melting temperatures were poorly predicted by existing algorithms. A new empirical relationship was derived from UV melting data that employs a quadratic function, which better models the melting temperatures of DNA duplex oligomers as sodium ion concentration is varied. Statistical analysis shows that this improved salt correction is significantly more accurate than previously suggested algorithms and predicts salt-corrected melting temperatures with an average error of only 1.6 \textdegree C when tested against an independent validation set of Tm measurements obtained from the literature. Differential scanning calorimetry studies demonstrate that this Tm salt correction is insensitive to DNA concentration. The Tm salt correction function was found to be sequence-dependent and varied with the fraction of G{$\cdot$}C base pairs, in agreement with previous studies of genomic and polymeric DNAs. The salt correction function is independent of oligomer length, suggesting that end-fraying and other end effects have little influence on the amount of sodium counterions released during duplex melting. The results are discussed in the context of counterion condensation theory.},

  abstract = {Metal ions are essential elements present in biological systems able to facilitate many cellular processes including proliferation, signaling, DNA synthesis and repair. Zinc ion (Zn(II)) is an important cofactor for numerous biochemical reactions. Commonly, structural zinc sites demonstrate high Zn(II) affinity and compact architecture required for sequence-specific macromolecule binding. However, how Zn(II)-dependent proteins fold, how their dissociation occurs, and which factors modulate zinc protein affinity as well as stability remains not fully understood. The molecular rules governing precise regulation of zinc proteins function are hidden in the relationship between sequence and structure, and hence require deep understanding of their folding mechanism under metal load, reactivity and metal-to-protein affinity. Even though, this sequence-structure relationship has an impact on zinc proteins function, it has been shown that other biological factors including cellular localization and Zn(II) availability influence overall protein behavior. Taking into account all of the mentioned factors, in this review, we aim to describe the relationship between structure-function-stability of zinc structural sites, found in a zinc finger, zinc hook and zinc clasps, and reach far beyond a structural point of view in order to appreciate the balance between chemistry and biology that govern the protein world.},

To date, this displacement has been described mostly for cysteine(Cys)-rich intraprotein binding sites in certain zinc finger domains and metallothioneins. To visualize how a ZnII-to-CdII swap can affect the target protein's status and thus understand the molecular basis of CdII-induced genotoxicity an intermolecular ZnII-binding site from the crucial DNA repair protein Rad50 and its zinc hook domain were examined. By using a length-varied peptide base, ZnII-to-CdII displacement in Rad50's hook domain is demonstrated to alter it in a bimodal fashion: 1) CdII induces around a two-orders-of-magnitude stabilization effect (log (Formula presented.) =20.8 vs. log (Formula presented.) =22.7), which defines an extremely high affinity of a peptide towards a metal ion, and 2) the displacement disrupts the overall assembly of the domain, as shown by NMR spectroscopic and anisotropy decay data. Based on the results, a new model explaining the molecular mechanism of CdII genotoxicity that underlines CdII's impact on Rad50's dimer stability and quaternary structure that could potentially result in abrogation of the major DNA damage response pathway is proposed.},

Trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) has been postulated to be necessary for the efficacy of insulin in regulating the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. However, the mechanism(s) for these roles and the essential function of Cr(III) in metabolism have not been substantiated. The criteria for the essentiality of a trace element were considered. It was noted that attempts to create chromium deficiency in animal models have not produced consistent results, and that there is no evidence of essentiality of Cr(III) in animal nutrition. Evaluating the possibility of Cr(III) as an essential element for humans, the evidence from reported improvements associated with chromium supplementation in patients on total parenteral nutrition was considered to be the most convincing, but overall data do not provide sufficient information on the reversibility of the possible deficiencies and the nature of any dose-response curve in order to identify a dietary requirement for humans. The Panel concludes that no Average Requirement and no Population Reference Intake for chromium can be defined. Several studies assessed the effect of chromium supplementation on glucose and/or lipid metabolism. In the only study for which information on total chromium intake was available, there was no difference in parameters of glucose metabolism of normoglycaemic subjects between the placebo and chromium-supplemented periods. The Panel considered that there is no evidence of beneficial effects associated with chromium intake in healthy subjects. The Panel concluded that the setting of an Adequate Intake for chromium is also not appropriate.},

The data suggest that the predominant structure is the intracomplex, in which the two parallel coiled coils proximal to the hook form a rod shape, and that a novel interface within the coiled-coil domains of Rad50 stabilizes the interaction of Rad50 protomers in the dimeric assembly. In yeast, removal of the coiled-coil interface compromised Tel1 activation without affecting DNA repair, while simultaneous disruption of that interface and the hook phenocopied a null mutation.

Class (a) acids prefer to bind to ``hard'' or nonpolarizable bases. Class (b) acids prefer to bind to ``soft'' or polarizable bases. Since class (a) acids are themselves ``hard'' and since class (b) acids are ``soft'' a simple, useful rule is proposed: hard acids bind strongly to hard bases and soft acids bind strongly to soft bases. The explanations for such behavior include: (1) various degrees of ionic and covalent {$\sigma$}-binding; (2) {$\pi$}-bonding; (3) electron correlation phenomena; (4) solvation effects. \textcopyright{} 1963, American Chemical Society.

Combining experimental data from these various structural proteomics techniques provides a more comprehensive examination of the protein structure and increases confidence in the ultimate findings.

The 2018 update of MetalPDB includes new contents and tools. A major extension is the inclusion of proteins whose structures do not contain metal ions although their sequences potentially contain a known MFS. In addition, MetalPDB now provides extensive statistical analyses addressing several aspects of general metal usage within the PDB, across protein families and in catalysis. Users can also query MetalPDB to extract statistical information on structural aspects associated with individual metals, such as preferred coordination geometries or aminoacidic environment. A further major improvement is the functional annotation of MFSs; the annotation is manually performed via a password-protected annotator interface. At present, {$\sim$}50\% of all MFSs have such a functional annotation. Other noteworthy improvements are bulk query functionality, through the upload of a list of PDB identifiers, and ftp access to MetalPDB contents, allowing users to carry out in-depth analyses on their own computational infrastructure.},

In this study, we used these probes to examine zinc binding by the Zap1 transcription factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Zap1 contains two zinc-regulated activation domains (ADs), AD1 and AD2. AD2 is located within two C 2 H 2 ZFs, ZF1 and ZF2. Studies have indicated that apoAD2 activates transcription and zinc binding to ZF1 and that ZF2 forms an interacting-finger-pair structure that is necessary to inhibit AD function. A related structural finger pair, ZF3 and ZF4, is found in the Zap1 DNA binding domain. In vitro studies indicated that, although the ZF1/2 and ZF3/4 finger pairs bind zinc with similar affinities, zinc that was bound to ZF1/2 was much more labile. We examined the properties of Zap1 ZFs in vivo by FRET. ZF pairs were flanked by enhanced yellow fluorescent protein and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein, allowing detection of zinc-induced conformation changes by FRET. By using these reporters, we found that ZF1/2 and ZF3/4 showed similar responses to zinc under steady-state conditions in vivo . In contrast, ZF1/2 zinc binding was significantly more labile than was ZF3/4. Also, ZF1/2 accumulated in an apo form that could rapidly bind zinc, whereas the ZF3/4 pair did not. Last, we show that these properties are evolutionarily conserved indicating their importance to Zap1 function. These results indicate that the kinetic lability of ZF1/2 in vivo is a key component of Zap1 zinc responsiveness.},

Several studies have shown that copper and zinc ions induce the formation of {$\gamma$}-crystallins aggregates.

Here, we evaluate the effect of Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions on the aggregation of H{$\beta$}A1, as a representative of the acidic form, and H{$\beta$}B2, as a representative of the basic {$\beta$}-crystallins. We used several biophysical techniques and computational methods to show that Cu(II) and Zn(II) induce aggregation following different pathways. Both metal ions destabilize the proteins and impact protein folding. Copper induced a small conformational change in H{$\beta$}A1, leading to high-molecular-weight light-scattering aggregates, while zinc is more aggressive towards H{$\beta$}B2 and induces a larger conformational change. Our work provides information on the mechanisms of metal-induced aggregation of {$\beta$}-crystallins.},

DNA breaks can also be introduced in a programmed manner, such as during the maturation of the immune system, meiosis, or cancer chemo- or radiotherapy. Cells have developed a variety of repair pathways, which are fine-tuned to the specific needs of a cell. Accordingly, vegetative cells employ mechanisms that restore the integrity of broken DNA with the highest efficiency at the lowest cost of mutagenesis. In contrast, meiotic cells or developing lymphocytes exploit DNA breakage to generate diversity. Here, we review the main pathways of eukaryotic DNA double-strand break repair with the focus on homologous recombination and its various subpathways. We highlight the differences between homologous recombination and end-joining mechanisms including non-homologous end-joining and microhomology-mediated end-joining and offer insights into how these pathways are regulated. Finally, we introduce noncanonical functions of the recombination proteins, in particular during DNA replication stress.},

In rodent tissue culture cells exposed to HgCl2, the metal ions were observed to concentrate in cell nuclei and to associate with chromatin. Thus, transcription factors and other proteins associated with chromatin are possible targets of mercuric ion toxicity. In this study, mercuric ions were found to inhibit the DNA binding activity of the Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) and Sp1. These factors are prototypes of the largest eukaryotic protein superfamily. Neither the presence of excess zinc ions nor {$\beta$}-mercaptoethanol prevented inhibition by mercuric ions. Mercuric ions also inhibited DNA binding by the non-zinc finger protein AP2. Zinc finger-DNA binding was inhibited when both TFIIIA/5S RNA complex and TFIIIA alone were preincubated with concentrations as low as 15 {$\mu$}M mercuric ion. Inhibition occurred in less than 1 min and was not readily reversible. Mercuric ions also inhibited the digestion of DNA by the restriction enzymes BamHI or EcoRI. Inhibition of transcription factors as well as potentially other DNA binding proteins by micromolar concentrations of mercuric ion suggests additional biochemical mechanisms for mercury toxicity in promoting disease via alterations in gene transcription patterns. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

MRN has two DNA-binding modes, one ATP-dependent mode for loading onto DNA ends and one ATP-independent mode through Mre11's C terminus, suggesting how it may interact with DSBs and intact DNA. MRNs two 60-nm-long coiled-coil domains form a linear rod structure, the apex of which is assembled by the two joined zinc-hook motifs. Apices from two MRN complexes can further dimerize, forming 120-nm spanning MRN-MRN structures.

Here, we show that the human CtIP (RBBP8) protein confers resistance to DSB-inducing agents and is recruited to DSBs exclusively in the S and G2 cell-cycle phases. Moreover, we reveal that CtIP is required for DSB resection, and thereby for recruitment of replication protein A (RPA) and the protein kinase ATR to DSBs, and for the ensuing ATR activation. Furthermore, we establish that CtIP physically and functionally interacts with the MRE11 complex, and that both CtIP and MRE11 are required for efficient homologous recombination. Finally, we reveal that CtIP has sequence homology with Sae2, which is involved in MRE11-dependent DSB processing in yeast. These findings establish evolutionarily conserved roles for CtIP-like proteins in controlling DSB resection, checkpoint signalling and homologous recombination. \textcopyright 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

ZnF domains take up diverse architectures with different ZnF motifs and have a wide range of biological functions. Nonetheless, predicting the ZnF motif(s) from the sequence is quite challenging. To this end, 74 unique ZnF sequence patterns are collected from the literature and classified into 32 different classes. Since the shorter length of ZnF sequence patterns leads to inaccurate predictions, ZnF domain Pfam HMM profiles defined under 6 ZnF Pfam clans (215 HMM profiles) and a few undefined Pfam clans (74 HMM profiles) are used for the prediction. A web server, namely, ZnF-Prot (https://project.iith.ac.in/znprot/) is developed which can predict the presence of 31 ZnF domains in a protein/proteome sequence of any organism. The use of ZnF sequence patterns and Pfam HMM profiles resulted in an accurate prediction of 610 test cases (taken randomly from 249 organisms) considered here. Additionally, the application of ZnF-Prot is demonstrated by considering Arabidopsis thaliana, Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Ciona intestinalis proteomes as test cases, wherein, 87\textendash 96\% of the predicted ZnF motifs are cross-validated.},

In this work, absorption, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy were employed to study the interaction of turn-on and ratiometric fluorescent indicators based on 4-oxo-4H-quinolizine-3-carboxylic acid with Mg2+ and ATP, the most abundant chelator of biological magnesium, thus revealing the formation of ternary complexes under conditions relevant to fluorescence imaging. The formation of ternary species elicits comparable or greater optical changes than those attributed to the formation of binary complexes alone. Dissociation of the fluorescent indicators from both ternary and binary species have apparent equilibrium constants in the low millimolar range at pH 7 and 25 C. These results suggest that these bidentate sensors are incapable of distinguishing between free Mg2+ and MgATP based on ratio or intensity-based steady-state fluorescence measurements, thus posing challenges in the interpretation of results from fluorescence imaging of magnesium in nucleotide-rich biological samples. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

However, if deployed in an inappropriate cellular context, these same repair functions can mediate chromosome rearrangements that underlie various human diseases, ranging from developmental disorders to cancer. The two major mechanisms of DSB repair in mammalian cells are non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination. In this Review, we consider DSB repair-pathway choice in somatic mammalian cells as a series of `decision trees', and explore how defective pathway choice can lead to genomic instability. Stalled, collapsed or broken DNA replication forks present a distinctive challenge to the DSB repair system. Emerging evidence suggests that the `rules' governing repair-pathway choice at stalled replication forks differ from those at replication-independent DSBs.},

Here, we report the crystal structures of the ATP{$\gamma$}S-bound dimer of the Rad50NBD (nucleotide-binding domain) from the thermophilic eukaryote Chaetomium thermophilum (Ct) in complex with either DNA or CtMre11RBD (Rad50-binding domain) along with small-angle X-ray scattering and cross-linking studies. The structure and DNA binding motifs were validated by DNA binding experiments in vitro and mutational analyses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in vivo. Our analyses provide a structural framework for the architecture of the eukaryotic Mre11-Rad50 complex. They show that a Rad50 dimer binds approximately 18 base pairs of DNA along the dimer interface in an ATP-dependent fashion or bridges two DNA ends with a preference for 3{${'}$} overhangs. Finally, our results may provide a general framework for the interaction of ABC ATPase domains of the Rad50/SMC/RecN protein family with DNA.},

However, contrary to what happens with biological systems containing Fe(II), Fe(III), Cu(II), Mn(II), Mn(III), Ni(II), Co(III) or other commonly found biologically relevant metal cofactors, the particular chemical properties of the Zn(II) ion mean that only a very small number of experimental techniques can be directly applied in the study of the metal coordination spheres present in Zinc proteins. The information obtainable from publicly available structural databases such as the Protein Data Bank can therefore be of particularly high significance to a better understanding of these proteins. In this study, we draw a detailed statistical portrait of the Zinc proteome by analysing the metal coordination spheres of the large number of X-ray crystallographic structures of Zinc proteins currently available on the Protein Data Bank. This data is further complemented with quantum mechanical calculations on the most common Zinc coordination spheres to evaluate the intrinsic thermodynamic stability of the several combinations of ligands on a generic and non-specific enzymatic environment, and with molecular electrostatic potential maps.

Important physiological functions in human metabolism are known for nine trace elements: selenium, zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, iron, molybdenum, iodine and fluoride. Lack of, or an insufficient supply of, these trace elements in nutrition therapy over a prolonged period is associated with trace element deprivation, which may lead to a deterioration of existing clinical symptoms and/or the development of characteristic malnutrition syndromes. Therefore, all parenteral nutrition prescriptions should include a daily dose of trace elements. To avoid trace element deprivation or imbalances, physiological doses are recommended.},

A complementary but considerably less explored approach is to display expression products of genomic DNA, cDNA, open reading frames (ORFs), or oligonucleotide libraries designed to encode defined regions of a target proteome on phage particles. One of the main applications of such proteomic libraries has been the elucidation of antibody epitopes. This review is focused on the use of proteomic phage display to uncover protein-protein interactions of potential relevance for cellular function.

There are some mechanisms in this process and transferrin may be involved in manganese transport into the brain. A large portion of manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins, especially glutamine synthetase in astrocytes. A portion of manganese probably exists in the synaptic vesicles in glutamatergic neurons and the manganese is dynamically coupled to the electrophysiological activity of the neurons. Manganese released into the synaptic cleft may influence synaptic neurotransmission. Dietary manganese deficiency, which may enhance susceptibility to epileptic functions, appears to affect manganese homeostasis in the brain, probably followed by alteration of neural activity. On the other hand, manganese also acts as a toxicant to the brain because this metal has prooxidant activity. Abnormal concentrations of manganese in the brain, especially in the basal ganglia, are associated with neurological disorders similar to Parkinson's disease. Understanding the movement and action of manganese in synapses may be important to clarify the function and toxicity of manganese in the brain. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, imaging of the human Mre11/Rad50 complex by high-speed AFM shows that the Rad50 coiled-coil arms are consistently bridged by the dimerized hooks while the Mre11/Rad50 ring opens by disconnecting the head domains; resembling other SMC proteins such as cohesin or condensin.

The method has two steps: appropriate protein/peptide mutation and native ESI-MS analysis using a variable-temperature sample inlet. In this work, two Hk mutants were produced, mixed with wild-type Hk, and measured at three different temperatures. A thermokinetic analysis of heterodimer formation allowed us to determine the enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy of activation for subunit exchange, showing that the reaction is slow and associated with a high enthalpic barrier, consistent with the exceptionally high stability of the Zn(Hk)2 assembly.},

To date, only a few protein complexes binding Zn(II) in an intermolecular manner have been deeply investigated. The most notable example of such interfaces is located in the highly conserved Rad50 protein, part of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, where Zn(II) is required for homodimerization (Zn(Rad50)2). The high stability of Zn(Rad50)2 is conserved not only for the protein derived from the thermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (logK12 = 20.95 for 130-amino-acid-long fragment), which was the first one studied, but also for the human paralog studied here (logK12 = 19.52 for a 183-amino-acid-long fragment). As we reported previously, the extremely high stability results from the metal-coupled folding process where particular Rad50 protein fragments play a critical role. The sequence\textendash structure\textendash stability analysis based on human Rad50 presented here separates the individual structural components that increase the stability of the complex, pointing to amino acid residues far away from the Zn(II) binding site as being largely responsible for the complex stabilization. The influence of the individual components is very well reflected by the previously published crystal structure of the human Rad50 zinc hook (PDB: 5GOX). In addition, we hereby report the effect of phosphorylation of the zinc hook domain, which exerts a destabilizing effect on the domain.

  abstract = {Genome instability, defined as higher than normal rates of mutation, is a double-edged sword. As a source of genetic diversity and natural selection, mutations are beneficial for evolution. On the other hand, genomic instability can have catastrophic consequences for age-related diseases such as cancer. Mutations arise either from inactivation of DNA repair pathways or in a repair-competent background due to genotoxic stress from celluar processes such as transcription and replication that overwhelm high-fidelity DNA repair. Here, we review recent studies that shed light on endogenous sources of mutation and epigenomic features that promote genomic instability during cancer evolution.},

  abstract = {Although metal ion homeostasis in cells is often mediated through metallochaperones, there are opportunities for toxic metals to be sequestered through the existing transport apparatus. Proper trafficking of CuI in human cells is partially achieved through complexation by HAH1, the human metallochaperone responsible for copper delivery to the Wilson and Menkes ATPase located in the trans-Golgi apparatus. In addition to binding copper, HAH1 strongly complexes HgII, with the X-ray structure of this complex previously described. It is important to clarify the solution behavior of these systems and, therefore, the binding of HgII to HAH1 was probed over the pH range 7.5 to 9.4 using 199Hg NMR, 199mHg PAC and UV-visible spectroscopies. The metal-dependent protein association over this pH range was examined using analytical gel-filtration. It can be concluded that at pH 7.5, HgII is bound to a monomeric HAH1 as a two coordinate, linear complex (HgS2), like the HgII-Atx1 X-ray structure (PDB ID: 1CC8). At pH 9.4, HgII promotes HAH1 association, leading to formation of HgS3 and HgS4 complexes, which are in exchange on the {$\mu$}s-ns time scale. Thus, structures that may represent central intermediates in the process of metal ion transfer, as well as their exchange kinetics have been characterized. HAH1, the HgII carrier? Trafficking of CuI in human cells is achieved through complexation by the metallochaperone, HAH1. In addition, HAH1 strongly binds HgII; the solution behavior of HgII-HAH1 complexation (see figure) has remained obscure, but is elucidated in this work. Structures are reported that may represent central intermediates in the processing of HgII ions. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

Recently, we identified three vanadium-binding proteins (vanabins), previously denoted as vanadium-associated proteins (VAPs) [Zool. Sci. 14 (1997) 37], from the cytoplasm fraction of vanadium-containing blood cells (vanadocytes) of the vanadium-rich ascidian Ascidia sydneiensis samea. Here, we describe the cloning, expression, and analysis of the metal-binding ability of vanabins. Recombinant proteins of two independent but related vanabins, vanabin1 and vanabin2, bound to 10 and 20 vanadium(IV) ions with dissociation constants of 2.1\texttimes 10-5 and 2.3\texttimes 10-5 M, respectively. The binding of vanadium(IV) to these vanabins was inhibited by the addition of copper(II) ions, but not by magnesium(II) or molybdate(VI) ions. Vanabins are the first proteins reported to show specific binding to vanadium ions; this should provide a clue to resolving the problem regarding the selective accumulation of vanadium in ascidians. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {The behaviour of mobile counterions, Na+ and K+, was analysed around a B-DNA double helix with the sequence CCATGCGCTGAC in aqueous solution during two 50 ns long molecular dynamics trajectories. The movement of both monovalent ions remains diffusive in the presence of DNA. Ions sample the complete space available during the simulation time, although individual ions sample only about one-third of the simulation box. Ions preferentially sample electronegative sites around DNA, but direct binding to DNA bases remains a rather rare event, with highest site occupancy values of {$<$}13\%. The location of direct binding sites depends greatly on the nature of the counterion. While Na+ binding in both grooves is strongly sequence-dependent with the preferred binding site in the minor groove, K+ mainly visits the major groove and binds close to the centre of the oligomer. The electrostatic potential of an average DNA structure therefore cannot account for the ability of a site to bind a given cation; other factors must also play a role. An extensive analysis of the influence of counterions on DNA conformation showed no evidence of minor groove narrowing upon ion binding. A significant difference between the conformations of the double helix in the different simulations can be attributed to extensive {$\alpha$}/{$\gamma$} transitions in the phosphate backbone during the simulation with Na+. These transitions, with lifetimes over tens of nano-seconds, however, appear to be correlated with ion binding to phosphates. The ion-specific conformational properties of DNA, hitherto largely overlooked, may play an important role in DNA recognition and binding. \textcopyright{} Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.},

By Gaussian analysis the difference absorption spectra of the various forms of metallothionein vs. thionein and of the corresponding 2-mercaptoethanol complexes vs. 2-mercaptoethanol were resolved into three components. For each metal derivative the location of the lowest energy band is in good agreement with the position of the first ligand-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transition (type t2 \textrightarrow{} a1) predicted from the optical electronegativity difference of the thiolate ligands and of the central metal ion by assuming tetrahedral coordination. There is also a correspondence between the effects of the metal ion on the position of the first LMCT band and the binding energy of the 2p electrons of the sulfur ligands as found by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements [Sokolowski, G., Pilz, W., \& Weser, U. (1974) FEBS Lett. 48, 222], Due to the lack of exact structural information, the assignment of the two other resolved metal-dependent bands remains conjectural, but it is likely that they include a second LMCT transition (type t2 \textrightarrow{} a1) analogous to that occurring in tetrahalide complexes of group-2B metal ions. The simplicity of the resolved thiolate spectra and their correspondence to those of tetrahedral models support the view that the various metal-binding sites of metallothionein are chemically similar and that the coordination environment of the metal ion has a symmetry related to that of a tetrahedron [Vasak, M.

The Mre11 dimer adopts a four-lobed U-shaped structure that is critical for proper MRN complex assembly and for binding and aligning DNA ends. Further, mutations blocking Mre11 endonuclease activity impair cell survival after DSB induction without compromising MRN complex assembly or Mre11-dependant recruitment of Ctp1, an HR factor, to DSBs.

They have been proved to be associated with protein structure, stability, regulation, and function.

Accurate characterizations and predictions of metalloproteins at the residue level promise informative clues to the investigation of intrinsic mechanisms of protein-metal ion interactions. Compared to biophysical or biochemical wet-lab technologies, computational methods provide open web interfaces of high-resolution databases and high-throughput predictors for efficient investigation of metal-binding residues. This review surveys and details 18 public databases of metal-protein binding. We collect a comprehensive set of 44 computation-based methods and classify them into four categories, namely, learning-, docking-, template-, and meta-based methods. We analyze the benchmark datasets, assessment criteria, feature construction, and algorithms. We also compare several methods on two benchmark testing datasets and include a discussion about currently publicly available predictive tools. Finally, we summarize the challenges and underlying limitations of the current studies and propose several prospective directions concerning the future development of the related databases and methods.},

Recent studies indicate that cohesin-mediated loop extrusion in developing B cells presents immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments to RAG endonuclease through a process referred to as RAG chromatin scanning. RAG initiates V(D)J recombinational joining of these gene segments to generate the large number of different Igh variable region exons that are required for immune responses to diverse pathogens. Antigen-activated mature B cells also use chromatin loop extrusion to mediate the synapsis, breakage and end joining of switch regions flanking Igh constant region exons during class-switch recombination, which allows for the expression of different antibody constant region isotypes that optimize the functions of antigen-specific antibodies to eliminate pathogens. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of chromatin loop extrusion during V(D)J recombination and class-switch recombination at the Igh locus.}

By measuring the frequency of each amino acid in metal ion-binding sites, the positive or negative preferences of each residue for each type of cation were identified. Our approach may be used for fast identification of metal-binding structural motifs that cannot be identified on the basis of sequence similarity alone. The analysis compares data derived separately from high and medium-resolution structures from the PDB with those from very high-resolution small-molecule structures in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). For high-resolution protein structures, the distribution of metal-protein or metal-water interaction distances agrees quite well with data from CSD, but the distribution is unrealistically wide for medium (2.0-2.5 \AA ) resolution data. Our analysis of cation B-factors versus average B-factors of atoms in the cation environment reveals substantial numbers of structures contain either an incorrect metal ion assignment or an unusual coordination pattern. Correlation between data resolution and completeness of the metal coordination spheres is also found. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Due to the abundance of poorly modeled or incorrectly identified Mg2+ ions, the set of all sites was comprehensively validated and filtered to identify a benchmark dataset of 15 334 'reliable' RNA-bound Mg2+ sites. The normalized frequencies by which specific RNA atoms coordinate Mg2+ were derived for both the inner and outer coordination spheres. A hierarchical classification system of Mg2+ sites in RNA structures was designed and applied to the benchmark dataset, yielding a set of 41 types of inner-sphere and 95 types of outer-sphere coordinating patterns. This classification system has also been applied to describe six previously reported Mg2+-binding motifs and detect them in new RNA structures. Investigation of the most populous site types resulted in the identification of seven novel Mg2+-binding motifs, and all RNA structures in the PDB were screened for the presence of these motifs.},

  abstract = {Formation of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) tails at a double-strand break (DSB) is a key step in homologous recombination and DNA-damage signaling. The enzyme(s) producing ssDNA at DSBs in eukaryotes remain unknown. We monitored 5{${'}$}-strand resection at inducible DSB ends in yeast and identified proteins required for two stages of resection: initiation and long-range 5{${'}$}-strand resection. We show that the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex (MRX) initiates 5{${'}$} degradation, whereas Sgs1 and Dna2 degrade 5{${'}$} strands exposing long 3{${'}$} strands. Deletion of SGS1 or DNA2 reduces resection and DSB repair by single-strand annealing between distant repeats while the remaining long-range resection activity depends on the exonuclease Exo1. In exo1{$\Delta$} sgs1{$\Delta$} double mutants, the MRX complex together with Sae2 nuclease generate, in a stepwise manner, only few hundred nucleotides of ssDNA at the break, resulting in inefficient gene conversion and G2/M damage checkpoint arrest. These results provide important insights into the early steps of DSB repair in eukaryotes. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
