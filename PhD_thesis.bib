abstract = {A number of Lewis acids of diverse types are classified as (a) or (b) following the criterion of Ahrland, Chatt, and Davies. Other, auxiliary criteria are proposed. Class (a) acids prefer to bind to “hard” or nonpolarizable bases. Class (b) acids prefer to bind to “soft” or polarizable bases. Since class (a) acids are themselves “hard” and since class (b) acids are “soft” a simple, useful rule is proposed: hard acids bind strongly to hard bases and soft acids bind strongly to soft bases. The explanations for such behavior include: (1) various degrees of ionic and covalent $\sigma$-binding; (2) $\pi$-bonding; (3) electron correlation phenomena; (4) solvation effects. {\textcopyright} 1963, American Chemical Society.

abstract = {We analysed the roles and distribution of metal ions in enzymatic catalysis using available public databases and our new resource Metal-MACiE ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/Metal{\_}MACiE/home.html ). In Metal-MACiE, a database of metal-based reaction mechanisms, 116 entries covering 21{\%} of the metal-dependent enzymes and 70{\%} of the types of enzyme-catalysed chemical transformations are annotated according to metal function. We used Metal-MACiE to assess the functions performed by metals in biological catalysis and the relative frequencies of different metals in different roles, which can be related to their individual chemical properties and availability in the environment. The overall picture emerging from the overview of Metal-MACiE is that redox-inert metal ions are used in enzymes to stabilize negative charges and to activate substrates by virtue of their Lewis acid properties, whereas redox-active metal ions can be used both as Lewis acids and as redox centres. Magnesium and zinc are by far the most common ions of the first type, while calcium is relatively less used. Magnesium, however, is most often bound to phosphate groups of substrates and interacts with the enzyme only transiently, whereas the other metals are stably bound to the enzyme. The most common metal of the second type is iron, which is prevalent in the catalysis of redox reactions, followed by manganese, cobalt, molybdenum, copper and nickel. The control of the reactivity of redox-active metal ions may involve their association with organic cofactors to form stable units. This occurs sometimes for iron and nickel, and quite often for cobalt and molybdenum. {\textcopyright} 2008 SBIC.},

abstract = {Period (PER) proteins are essential components of the mammalian circadian clock. They form complexes with cryptochromes (CRY), which negatively regulate CLOCK/BMAL1-dependent transactivation of clock and clock-controlled genes. To define the roles of mammalian CRY/PER complexes in the circadian clock, we have determined the crystal structure of a complex comprising the photolyase homology region of mouse CRY1 (mCRY1) and a C-terminal mouse PER2 (mPER2) fragment. mPER2 winds around the helical mCRY1 domain covering the binding sites of FBXL3 and CLOCK/BMAL1, but not the FAD binding pocket. Our structure revealed an unexpected zinc ion in one interface, which stabilizes mCRY1-mPER2 interactions in vivo. We provide evidence that mCRY1/mPER2 complex formation is modulated by an interplay of zinc binding and mCRY1 disulfide bond formation, which may be influenced by the redox state of the cell. Our studies may allow for the development of circadian and metabolic modulators. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex is a dynamic macromolecular machine that acts in the first steps of DNA double strand break repair, and each of its components has intrinsic dynamics and flexibility properties that are directly linked with their functions. As a result, deciphering the functional structural biology of the MRN complex is driving novel and integrated technologies to define the dynamic structural biology of protein machinery interacting with DNA. Rad50 promotes dramatic long-range allostery through its coiled-coil and zinc-hook domains. Its ATPase activity drives dynamic transitions between monomeric and dimeric forms that can be modulated with mutants modifying the ATPase rate to control end joining versus resection activities. The biological functions of Mre11's dual endo- and exonuclease activities in repair pathway choice were enigmatic until recently, when they were unveiled by the development of specific nuclease inhibitors. Mre11 dimer flexibility, which may be regulated in cells to control MRN function, suggests new inhibitor design strategies for cancer intervention. Nbs1 has FHA and BRCT domains to bind multiple interaction partners that further regulate MRN. One of them, CtIP, modulates the Mre11 excision activity for homologous recombination repair. Overall, these combined properties suggest novel therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, they collectively help to explain how MRN regulates DNA repair pathway choice with implications for improving the design and analysis of cancer clinical trials that employ DNA damaging agents or target the DNA damage response.},

MFSs are 3D templates that describe the local environment around the metal(s) independently of the larger context of the macromolecular structure embedding the site(s), and are the central objects of MetalPDB design. MFSs are grouped into equistructural (broadly defined as sites found in corresponding positions in similar structures) and equivalent sites (equistructural sites that contain the same metals), allowing users to easily analyse similarities and variations in metal-macromolecule interactions, and to link them to functional information. The web interface of MetalPDB allows access to a comprehensive overview of metal-containing biological structures, providing a basis to investigate the basic principles governing the properties of these systems.

abstract = {Analysis of metal-protein interaction distances, coordination numbers, B-factors (displacement parameters), and occupancies of metal-binding sites in protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography and deposited in the PDB shows many unusual values and unexpected correlations. By measuring the frequency of each amino acid in metal ion-binding sites, the positive or negative preferences of each residue for each type of cation were identified. Our approach may be used for fast identification of metal-binding structural motifs that cannot be identified on the basis of sequence similarity alone. The analysis compares data derived separately from high and medium-resolution structures from the PDB with those from very high-resolution small-molecule structures in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). For high-resolution protein structures, the distribution of metal-protein or metal-water interaction distances agrees quite well with data from CSD, but the distribution is unrealistically wide for medium (2.0-2.5 {\AA}) resolution data. Our analysis of cation B-factors versus average B-factors of atoms in the cation environment reveals substantial numbers of structures contain either an incorrect metal ion assignment or an unusual coordination pattern. Correlation between data resolution and completeness of the metal coordination spheres is also found. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Zinc is indispensable to all forms of life as it is an essential component of many different proteins involved in a wide range of biological processes. Not differently from other metals, zinc in proteins can play different roles that depend on the features of the metal-binding site. In this work, we describe zinc sites in proteins with known structure by means of three-dimensional templates that can be automatically extracted from PDB files and consist of the protein structure around the metal, including the zinc ligands and the residues in close spatial proximity to the ligands. This definition is devised to intrinsically capture the features of the local protein environment that can affect metal function, and corresponds to what we call a minimal functional site (MFS). We used MFSs to classify all zinc sites whose structures are available in the PDB and combined this classification with functional annotation as available in the literature. We classified 77{\%} of zinc sites into ten clusters, each grouping zinc sites with structures that are highly similar, and an additional 16{\%} into seven pseudo-clusters, each grouping zinc sites with structures that are only broadly similar. Sites where zinc plays a structural role are predominant in eight clusters and in two pseudo-clusters, while sites where zinc plays a catalytic role are predominant in two clusters and in five pseudo-clusters. We also analyzed the amino acid composition of the coordination sphere of zinc as a function of its role in the protein, highlighting trends and exceptions. In a period when the number of known zinc proteins is expected to grow further with the increasing awareness of the cellular mechanisms of zinc homeostasis, this classification represents a valuable basis for structure-function studies of zinc proteins, with broad applications in biochemistry, molecular pharmacology and de novo protein design. {\textcopyright} 2011 Andreini et al.},

However, contrary to what happens with biological systems containing Fe(II), Fe(III), Cu(II), Mn(II), Mn(III), Ni(II), Co(III) or other commonly found biologically relevant metal cofactors, the particular chemical properties of the Zn(II) ion mean that only a very small number of experimental techniques can be directly applied in the study of the metal coordination spheres present in Zinc proteins. The information obtainable from publicly available structural databases such as the Protein Data Bank can therefore be of particularly high significance to a better understanding of these proteins. In this study, we draw a detailed statistical portrait of the Zinc proteome by analysing the metal coordination spheres of the large number of X-ray crystallographic structures of Zinc proteins currently available on the Protein Data Bank. This data is further complemented with quantum mechanical calculations on the most common Zinc coordination spheres to evaluate the intrinsic thermodynamic stability of the several combinations of ligands on a generic and non-specific enzymatic environment, and with molecular electrostatic potential maps. These results provide useful insights into this difficult to characterize but very important Zn-containing subset of the proteome. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {The geometrical properties of zinc binding sites in a dataset of high quality protein crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank have been examined to identify important differences between zinc sites that are directly involved in catalysis and those that play a structural role. Coordination angles in the zinc primary coordination sphere are compared with ideal values for each coordination geometry, and zinc coordination distances are compared with those in small zinc complexes from the Cambridge Structural Database as a guide of expected trends. We find that distances and angles in the primary coordination sphere are in general close to the expected (or ideal) values. Deviations occur primarily for oxygen coordinating atoms and are found to be mainly due to H-bonding of the oxygen coordinating ligand to protein residues, bidentate binding arrangements, and multi-zinc sites. We find that H-bonding of oxygen containing residues (or water) to zinc bound histidines is almost universal in our dataset and defines the elec-His-Zn motif. Analysis of the stereochemistry shows that carboxyl elec-His-Zn motifs are geometrically rigid, while water elec-His-Zn motifs show the most geometrical variation. As catalytic motifs have a higher proportion of carboxyl elec atoms than structural motifs, they provide a more rigid framework for zinc binding. This is understood biologically, as a small distortion in the zinc position in an enzyme can have serious consequences on the enzymatic reaction. We also analyze the sequence pattern of the zinc ligands and residues that provide elecs, and identify conserved hydrophobic residues in the endopeptidases that also appear to contribute to stabilizing the catalytic zinc site. A zinc binding template in protein crystal structures is derived from these observations.},

abstract = {From the catalytic reactions that sustain the global oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon cycles to the stabilization of DNA processing proteins, transition metal ions and metallocofactors play key roles in biology. Although the exquisite interplay between metal ions and protein scaffolds has been studied extensively, the fact that the biological roles of the metals often stem from their placement in the interfaces between proteins and protein subunits is not always recognized. Interfacial metal ions stabilize permanent or transient protein-protein interactions, enable protein complexes involved in cellular signaling to adopt distinct conformations in response to environmental stimuli, and catalyze challenging chemical reactions that are uniquely performed by multisubunit protein complexes. This review provides a structural survey of transition metal ions and metallocofactors found in protein-protein interfaces, along with a series of selected examples that illustrate their diverse biological utility and significance.

abstract = {We obtained an extended functional annotation of zinc proteins using a combination of bioinformatic methods. This work was performed using a number of available predicted zinc proteomes of various representative organisms, leading to the almost complete annotation of, among others, the predicted human zinc proteome. The computational tools exploited included sequence-based and, when possible, structure-based functional predictions. We assigned a hypothetical function to 74{\%} of the 1,472 sequences analyzed that lacked annotation in the starting dataset. We also added new functional categories, not described in the reference dataset, such as ubiquitin binding and DNA replication. As a general conclusion, we can state that the quality of each functional prediction parallels the amount of information for the sequence analyzed: the larger the amount of information, the more detailed and reliable is the proposed functional prediction. Among the findings, we have propose a zinc binding site for archaeal zinc-importing proteins. Furthermore, we propose two groups of transcriptional regulators that are involved in fatty acid metabolism. {\textcopyright} 2010 SBIC.},

abstract = {The Rad50 hook interface is crucial for assembly and various functions of the Mre11 complex. Previous analyses suggested that Rad50 molecules interact within (intracomplex) or between (intercomplex) dimeric complexes. In this study, we determined the structure of the human Rad50 hook and coiled-coil domains. The data suggest that the predominant structure is the intracomplex, in which the two parallel coiled coils proximal to the hook form a rod shape, and that a novel interface within the coiled-coil domains of Rad50 stabilizes the interaction of Rad50 protomers in the dimeric assembly. In yeast, removal of the coiled-coil interface compromised Tel1 activation without affecting DNA repair, while simultaneous disruption of that interface and the hook phenocopied a null mutation. The results demonstrate that the hook and coiled-coil interfaces coordinately promote intracomplex assembly and define the intracomplex as the functional form of the Mre11 complex.},

abstract = {The Mre11 complex (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) is central to chromosomal maintenance and functions in homologous recombination, telomere maintenance and sister chromatid association. These functions all imply that the linked binding of two DNA substrates occurs, although the molecular basis for this process remains unknown. Here we present a 2.2 {\AA} crystal structure of the Rad50 coiled-coil region that reveals an unexpected dimer interface at the apex of the coiled coils in which pairs of conserved Cys-X-X-Cys motifs form interlocking hooks that bind one Zn2+ ion. Biochemical, X-ray and electron microscopy data indicate that these hooks can join oppositely protruding Rad50 coiled-coil domains to form a flexible bridge of up to 1, 200 {\AA}. This suggests a function for the long insertion in the Rad50 ABC-ATPase domain. The Rad50 hook is functional, because mutations in this motif confer radiation sensitivity in yeast and disrupt binding at the distant Mre11 nuclease interface. These data support an architectural role for the Rad50 coiled coils in forming metal-mediated bridging complexes between two DNA-binding heads. The resulting assemblies have appropriate lengths and conformational properties to link sister chromatids in homologous recombination and DNA ends in non-homologous end-joining.},

abstract = {Zn2+, an element that is essential to all life forms, can play a catalytic or a solely structural role. Previous works have shown that Zn2+ binds preferentially to water molecules and His in catalytic sites, but to Cys- instructural sites, but the molecular basis for the observed ligand preference is unclear. Here, we show that the different Zn2+ roles are also reflected in the different bond distances to Zn2+ in structural and catalytic sites. We reveal the physical basis for the observed differences between structural and catalytic Zn sites: In most catalytic sites, water is found bound to Zn2+ as it transfers the least charge to Zn2+ and is less bulky compared to the protein ligands, enabling Zn2+ to serve as a Lewis acid in catalysis. In most structural sites, however, ≥ 2 Cys- are found bound to Zn2+, as Cys- transfers the most charge to Zn2+ and reduces the Zn charge to such an extent that Zn2+ can no longer act as a Lewis acid; furthermore, steric repulsion among the bulky Cys(S-) prevents Zn2+ from accommodating another ligand. Based on the observed ligand preference and Zn-ligand distance differences between structural and catalytic Zn sites, we present a simple method for distinguishing the two types of sites and for verifying the catalytic role of Zn2+. Finally, we discuss how the physical bases revealed aid in designing potential drug molecules that target Zn proteins. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Zinc is known to be indispensable to growth and development and transmission of the genetic message. It does this through a remarkable mosaic of zinc binding motifs that orchestrate all aspects of metabolism. There are now nearly 200 three dimensional structures for zinc proteins, representing all six classes of enzymes and covering a wide range of phyla and species. These structures provide standards of reference for the identity and nature of zinc ligands in other proteins for which only the primary structure is known. Three primary types of zinc sites are apparent from examination of these structures: structural, catalytic and cocatalytic. The most common amino acids that supply ligands to these sites are His, Glu, Asp and Cys. In catalytic sites zinc generally forms complexes with water and any three nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur donors with His being the predominant amino acid chosen. Water is always a ligand to such sites. Structural zinc sites have four protein ligands and no bound water molecule. Cys is the preferred ligand in such sites. Cocatalytic sites contain two or three metals in close proximity with two of the metals bridged by a side chain moiety of a single amino acid residue, such as Asp, Glu or His and sometimes a water molecule. Asp and His are the preferred amino acids for these sites. No Cys ligands are found in such sites. The scaffolding of the zinc sites is also important to the function and reactivity of the bound metal. The influence of zinc on quaternary protein structure has led to the identification of a fourth type of zinc binding site, protein interface. In this case zinc sites are formed from ligands supplied from amino acid residues residing in the binding surface of two proteins. The resulting zinc site usually has the coordination properties of a catalytic or structural zinc binding site.},

abstract = {Many proteins in living cells require cofactors to carry out their biological functions. To reach their functional states, these proteins need to fold into their unique three-dimensional structures in the presence of their cofactors. Two processes, folding of the protein and binding of cofactors, intermingle with each other, making the direct elucidation of the folding mechanism of proteins in the presence of cofactors challenging. Here we use single-molecule atomic force microscopy to directly monitor the folding and cofactor binding dynamics of an engineered metal-binding protein G6-53 at the single-molecule level. Using the mechanical stability of different conformers of G6-53 as sensitive probes, we directly identified different G6-53 conformers (unfolded, apo- and Ni 2+-bound) populated along the folding pathway of G6-53 in the presence of its cofactor Ni 2+. By carrying out single-molecule atomic force microscopy refolding experiments, we monitored kinetic evolution processes of these different conformers. Our results suggested that the majority of G6-53 folds through a binding-after-folding mechanism, whereas a small fraction follows a binding-before-folding pathway. Our study opens an avenue to utilizing force spectroscopy techniques to probe the folding dynamics of proteins in the presence of cofactors at the single-molecule level, and we anticipated that this method can be used to study a wide variety of proteins requiring cofactors for their function. {\textcopyright} 2011 Biophysical Society.},

These varied functions are often dependent upon macromolecular interactions, particularly with other proteins. Small-scale studies in the scientific literature report protein–protein interactions (PPIs), but slowly and with bias towards well-studied proteins. In an era where genomic sequence is readily available, deducing genotype–phenotype relationships requires an understanding of protein connectivity at proteome-scale. A proteome-scale map of the protein–protein interaction network provides a global view of cellular organization and function. Here, we discuss a summary of methods for building proteome-scale interactome maps and the current status and implications of mapping achievements. Not only do interactome maps serve as a reference, detailing global cellular function and organization patterns, but they can also reveal the mechanisms altered by disease alleles, highlight the patterns of interaction rewiring across evolution, and help pinpoint biologically and therapeutically relevant proteins. Despite the considerable strides made in proteome-wide mapping, several technical challenges persist. Therefore, future considerations that impact current mapping efforts are also discussed.},

abstract = {Metal ions are essential elements present in biological systems able to facilitate many cellular processes including proliferation, signaling, DNA synthesis and repair. Zinc ion (Zn(II)) is an important cofactor for numerous biochemical reactions. Commonly, structural zinc sites demonstrate high Zn(II) affinity and compact architecture required for sequence-specific macromolecule binding. However, how Zn(II)-dependent proteins fold, how their dissociation occurs, and which factors modulate zinc protein affinity as well as stability remains not fully understood. The molecular rules governing precise regulation of zinc proteins function are hidden in the relationship between sequence and structure, and hence require deep understanding of their folding mechanism under metal load, reactivity and metal-to-protein affinity. Even though, this sequence-structure relationship has an impact on zinc proteins function, it has been shown that other biological factors including cellular localization and Zn(II) availability influence overall protein behavior. Taking into account all of the mentioned factors, in this review, we aim to describe the relationship between structure-function-stability of zinc structural sites, found in a zinc finger, zinc hook and zinc clasps, and reach far beyond a structural point of view in order to appreciate the balance between chemistry and biology that govern the protein world.},

This structural dynamics is considered to be important for many regulatory and sensory adaptation processes that occur in vivo. We have developed an accurate method for monitoring protein subunit exchange by using native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), exemplified here for an extremely stable Rad50 zinc hook (Hk) dimer assembly, Zn(Hk)2. The method has two steps: appropriate protein/peptide mutation and native ESI-MS analysis using a variable-temperature sample inlet. In this work, two Hk mutants were produced, mixed with wild-type Hk, and measured at three different temperatures. A thermokinetic analysis of heterodimer formation allowed us to determine the enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy of activation for subunit exchange, showing that the reaction is slow and associated with a high enthalpic barrier, consistent with the exceptionally high stability of the Zn(Hk)2 assembly.},

abstract = {The binding of metal ions at the interface of protein complexes presents a unique and poorly understood mechanism of molecular assembly. A remarkable example is the Rad50 zinc hook domain, which is highly conserved and facilitates the Zn 2+ -mediated homodimerization of Rad50 proteins. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the structural and thermodynamic effects governing the formation and stability (log K 12 = 20.74) of this evolutionarily conserved protein assembly. We have dissected the determinants of the stability contributed by the small $\beta$-hairpin of the domain surrounding the zinc binding motif and the coiled-coiled regions using peptides of various lengths from 4 to 45 amino acid residues, alanine substitutions and peptide bond-to-ester perturbations. In the studied series of peptides, an {\textgreater}650 000-fold increase of the formation constant of the dimeric complex arises from favorable enthalpy because of the increased acidity of the cysteine thiols in metal-free form and the structural properties of the dimer. The dependence of the enthalpy on the domain fragment length is partially compensated by the entropic penalty of domain folding, indicating enthalpy-entropy compensation. This study facilitates understanding of the metal-mediated protein-protein interactions in which the metal ion is critical for the tight association of protein subunits.},

To date, this displacement has been described mostly for cysteine(Cys)-rich intraprotein binding sites in certain zinc finger domains and metallothioneins. To visualize how a ZnII-to-CdII swap can affect the target protein's status and thus understand the molecular basis of CdII-induced genotoxicity an intermolecular ZnII-binding site from the crucial DNA repair protein Rad50 and its zinc hook domain were examined. By using a length-varied peptide base, ZnII-to-CdII displacement in Rad50's hook domain is demonstrated to alter it in a bimodal fashion: 1) CdII induces around a two-orders-of-magnitude stabilization effect (log (Formula presented.) =20.8 vs. log (Formula presented.) =22.7), which defines an extremely high affinity of a peptide towards a metal ion, and 2) the displacement disrupts the overall assembly of the domain, as shown by NMR spectroscopic and anisotropy decay data. Based on the results, a new model explaining the molecular mechanism of CdII genotoxicity that underlines CdII's impact on Rad50's dimer stability and quaternary structure that could potentially result in abrogation of the major DNA damage response pathway is proposed.},

abstract = {Background: Information on the occurrence of zinc finger protein motifs in genomes is crucial to the developing field of molecular genome engineering. The knowledge of their target DNA-binding sequences is vital to develop chimeric proteins for targeted genome engineering and site-specific gene correction. There is a need to develop a computational resource of zinc finger proteins (ZFP) to identify the potential binding sites and its location, which reduce the time of in vivo task, and overcome the difficulties in selecting the specific type of zinc finger protein and the target site in the DNA sequence. Description: ZifBASE provides an extensive collection of various natural and engineered ZFP. It uses standard names and a genetic and structural classification scheme to present data retrieved from UniProtKB, GenBank, Protein Data Bank, ModBase, Protein Model Portal and the literature. It also incorporates specialized features of ZFP including finger sequences and positions, number of fingers, physiochemical properties, classes, framework, PubMed citations with links to experimental structures (PDB, if available) and modeled structures of natural zinc finger proteins. ZifBASE provides information on zinc finger proteins (both natural and engineered ones), the number of finger units in each of the zinc finger proteins (with multiple fingers), the synergy between the adjacent fingers and their positions. Additionally, it gives the individual finger sequence and their target DNA site to which it binds for better and clear understanding on the interactions of adjacent fingers. The current version of ZifBASE contains 139 entries of which 89 are engineered ZFPs, containing 3-7F totaling to 296 fingers. There are 50 natural zinc finger protein entries ranging from 2-13F, totaling to 307 fingers. It has sequences and structures from literature, Protein Data Bank, ModBase and Protein Model Portal. The interface is cross linked to other public databases like UniprotKB, PDB, ModBase and Protein Model Portal and PubMed for making it more informative. Conclusion: A database is established to maintain the information of the sequence features, including the class, framework, number of fingers, residues, position, recognition site and physio-chemical properties (molecular weight, isoelectric point) of both natural and engineered zinc finger proteins and dissociation constant of few. ZifBASE can provide more effective and efficient way of accessing the zinc finger protein sequences and their target binding sites with the links to their three-dimensional structures. All the data and functions are available at the advanced web-based search interface http://web.iitd.ac.in/{\~{}}sundar/zifbase. {\textcopyright} 2009 Jayakanthan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Zinc is one of the metal ions essential for life, as it is required for the proper functioning of a large number of proteins. Despite its importance, the annotation of zinc-binding proteins in gene banks or protein domain databases still has significant room for improvement. In the present work, we compiled a list of known zinc-binding protein domains and of known zinc-binding sequence motifs (zinc-binding patterns), and then used them jointly to analyze the proteome of 57 different organisms to obtain an overview of zinc usage by archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic organisms. Zinc-binding proteins are an abundant fraction of these proteomes, ranging between 4{\%} and 10{\%}. The number of zinc-binding proteins correlates linearly with the total number of proteins encoded by the genome of an organism, but the proportionality constant of Eukaryota (8.8{\%}) is significantly higher than that observed in Bacteria and Archaea (from 5{\%} to 6{\%}). Most of this enrichment is due to the larger portfolio of regulatory proteins in Eukaryota. Keywords:},

abstract = {Genome-wide studies are providing researchers with a potentially complete list of the molecular components present In living systems. It is now evident that several metal ions are essential to life and that metalloproteins, that is, proteins that require a metal ion to perform their physiological function, are widespread in all organisms. However, there is currently a lack of well-established experimental methods aimed at analyzing the complete set of metalloproteins encoded by an organism (the metalloproteome). This information is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the whole of the processes occurring in living systems. Predictive tools must thus be applied to define metalloproteomes. In this Account, we discuss the current progress in the development of bioinformatics methods for the prediction, based solely on protein sequences, of metalloproteins. With these methods, it is possible to scan entire proteomes for metalloproteins, such as zinc proteins or copper proteins, which are identified by the presence of specific metal-binding sites, metal-binding domains, or both. The predicted metalloproteins can be then analyzed to obtain information on their function and evolution. For example, the comparative analysis of the content and usage of different metalloproteins across living organisms can be used to obtain hints on the evolution of metalloproteomes. As case studies, we predicted the content of zinc, nonheme iron, and copper-proteins in a representative set of organisms taken from the three domains of life. The zinc proteome represents about 9{\%} of the entire proteome in eukaryotes, but it ranges from 5{\%} to 6{\%} in prokaryotes, therefore indicating a substantial increase of the number of zinc proteins in higher organisms. In contrast, the number of nonheme iron proteins is relatively constant in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and therefore their relative share diminishes in passing from archaea (about 7{\%}), to bacteria (about 4{\%}), to eukaryotes (about 1{\%}). Copper proteins represent less than 1{\%} of the proteomes in all the organisms studied. We also discuss the limits of these methods, the approaches used to overcome some of these limits to improve our predictions, and possible future developments in the field of bioinformatics-based investigation of metalloproteins. As a longstanding goal of the biological sciences, the understanding of life at the systems level, or systems biology, is experiencing a rekindling of interest; ready access to complete information on metalloproteomes is crucial to correctly represent the role of metal ions in living organisms. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Metal ions are constituents of many metalloproteins, in which they have either catalytic (metalloenzymes) or structural functions. In this work, the characteristics of various metals were studied (Cu, Zn, Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cd and Ca in proteins with known crystal structure) as well as the specificity of their environments. The analysis was performed on two data sets: the set of protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) determined with resolution {\textless}1.5 {\AA} and the set of nonredundant protein structures from the PDB. The former was used to determine the distances between each metal ion and its electron donors and the latter was used to assess the preferred coordination numbers and common combinations of amino-acid residues in the neighbourhood of each metal. Although the metal ions considered predominantly had a valence of two, their preferred coordination number and the type of amino-acid residues that participate in the coordination differed significantly from one metal ion to the next. This study concentrates on finding the specificities of a metal-ion environment, namely the distribution of coordination numbers and the amino-acid residue types that frequently take part in coordination. Furthermore, the correlation between the coordination number and the occurrence of certain amino-acid residues (quartets and triplets) in a metal-ion coordination sphere was analysed. The results obtained are of particular value for the identification and modelling of metal-binding sites in protein structures derived by homology modelling. Knowledge of the geometry and characteristics of the metal-binding sites in metalloproteins of known function can help to more closely determine the biological activity of proteins of unknown function and to aid in design of proteins with specific affinity for certain metals. {\textcopyright} International Union of Crystallography 2008.},

abstract = {Fis is an abundant bacterial DNA binding protein that functions in many different reactions. We show here that Fis subunits rapidly exchange between dimers in solution by disulfide cross-linking mixtures of Fis mutants with different electrophoretic mobilities and by monitoring energy transfer between fluorescently labeled Fis subunits upon heterodimer formation. The effects of detergents and salt concentrations on subunit exchange imply that the dimer is predominantly stabilized by hydrophobic forces, consistent with the X-ray crystal structures. Specific and nonspecific DNA strongly inhibit Fis subunit exchange. In all crystal forms of Fis, the separation between the DNA recognition helices within the Fis dimer is too short to insert into adjacent major grooves on canonical B-DNA, implying that conformational changes within the Fis dimer and/or the DNA must occur upon binding. We therefore investigated the functional importance of dimer interface flexibility for Fis-DNA binding by studying the DNA binding properties of Fis mutants that were cross-linked at different positions in the dimer. Flexibility within the core dimer interface does not appear to be required for efficient DNA binding, Fis-DNA complex dissociation, or Fis-induced DNA bending. Moreover, FRET-based experiments provided no evidence for a change in the spatial relationship between the two helix-turn-helix motifs in the Fis dimer upon DNA binding. These results support a model in which the unusually short distance between DNA recognition helices on Fis is accommodated primarily through bending of the DNA.},

abstract = {Zinc metalloproteins are one of the most abundant and structurally diverse proteins in nature. In these proteins, the Zn(II) ion possesses a multifunctional role as it stabilizes the fold of small zinc fingers, catalyzes essential reactions in enzymes of all six classes, or assists in the formation of biological oligomers. Previously, a number of database surveys have been conducted on zinc proteins to gain broader insights into their rich coordination chemistry. However, many of these surveys suffer from severe flaws and misinterpretations or are otherwise limited. To provide a more comprehensive, up-to-date picture on zinc coordination environments in proteins, zinc containing protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) were analyzed in detail. A statistical analysis in terms of zinc coordinating amino acids, metal-to-ligand bond lengths, coordination number, and structural classification was performed, revealing coordination spheres from classical tetrahedral cysteine/histidine binding sites to more complex binuclear sites with carboxylated lysine residues. According to the results, coordination spheres of hundreds of crystal structures in the PDB could be misinterpreted due to symmetry-related molecules or missing electron densities for ligands. The analysis also revealed increasing average metal-to-ligand bond length as a function of crystallographic resolution, which should be taken into account when interrogating metal ion binding sites. Moreover, one-third of the zinc ions present in crystal structures are artifacts, merely aiding crystal formation and packing with no biological significance. Our analysis provides solid evidence that a minimal stable zinc coordination sphere is made up by four ligands and adopts a tetrahedral coordination geometry. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

One of the main applications of such proteomic libraries has been the elucidation of antibody epitopes. This review is focused on the use of proteomic phage display to uncover protein-protein interactions of potential relevance for cellular function. The method is particularly suited for the discovery of interactions between peptide binding domains and their targets.

The 2018 update of MetalPDB includes new contents and tools. A major extension is the inclusion of proteins whose structures do not contain metal ions although their sequences potentially contain a known MFS. In addition, MetalPDB now provides extensive statistical analyses addressing several aspects of general metal usage within the PDB, across protein families and in catalysis. Users can also query MetalPDB to extract statistical information on structural aspects associated with individual metals, such as preferred coordination geometries or aminoacidic environment. A further major improvement is the functional annotation of MFSs; the annotation is manually performed via a password-protected annotator interface. At present, ∼50{\%} of all MFSs have such a functional annotation. Other noteworthy improvements are bulk query functionality, through the upload of a list of PDB identifiers, and ftp access to MetalPDB contents, allowing users to carry out in-depth analyses on their own computational infrastructure.},

@article{Bushmarina2006,
abstract = {About 30{\%} of proteins require cofactors for their proper folding. The effects of cofactors on the folding reaction have been investigated with alpha-lactalbumin as a model protein and metal ions as cofactors. Metal ions accelerate the refolding of alpha-lactalbumin by lessening the energy barrier between the molten globule state and the transition state, mainly by decreasing the difference of entropy between the two states. These effects are linked to metal ion binding to the protein in the native state. Hence, relationships between the metal affinities for the intermediate states and those for the native state are observed. Some residual specificity for the calcium ion is still observed in the molten globule state, this specificity getting closer in the transition state to that of the native state. The comparison between kinetic and steady-state data in association with the Phi value method indicates the binding of the metal ions on the unfolded state of alpha-lactalbumin. Altogether, these results provide insight into cofactor effects on protein folding. They also suggest new possibilities to investigate the presence of residual native structures in the unfolded state of protein and the effects of such structures on the protein folding reaction and on protein stability.},

@article{Fields1989,
abstract = {PROTEIN-protein interactions between two proteins have generally been studied using biochemical techniques such as crosslinking, co-immunoprecipitation and co-fractionation by chromatography. We have generated a novel genetic system to study these interactions by taking advantage of the properties of the GAL4 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein is a transcriptional activator required for the expression of genes encoding enzymes of galactose utilization. It consists of two separable and functionally essential domains: an N-terminal domain which binds to specific DNA sequences (UASG); and a C-terminal domain containing acidic regions, which is necessary to activate transcription. We have generated a system of two hybrid proteins containing parts of GAL4: the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to a protein 'X' and a GAL4 activating region fused to a protein 'Y'. If X and Y can form a protein-protein complex and reconstitute proximity of the GAL4 domains, tran-scription of a gene regulated by UASG occurs. We have tested this system using two yeast proteins that are known to interact-SNF1 and SNF4. High transcriptional activity is obtained only when both hybrids are present in a cell. This system may be applicable as a general method to identify proteins that interact with a known protein by the use of a simple galactose selection. {\textcopyright} 1989 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Tran2022,
abstract = {The metal binding at protein–protein interfaces is still uncharted territory in intermolecular interactions. To date, only a few protein complexes binding Zn(II) in an intermolecular manner have been deeply investigated. The most notable example of such interfaces is located in the highly conserved Rad50 protein, part of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, where Zn(II) is required for homodimerization (Zn(Rad50)2). The high stability of Zn(Rad50)2 is conserved not only for the protein derived from the thermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (logK12 = 20.95 for 130-amino-acid-long fragment), which was the first one studied, but also for the human paralog studied here (logK12 = 19.52 for a 183-amino-acid-long fragment). As we reported previously, the extremely high stability results from the metal-coupled folding process where particular Rad50 protein fragments play a critical role. The sequence–structure–stability analysis based on human Rad50 presented here separates the individual structural components that increase the stability of the complex, pointing to amino acid residues far away from the Zn(II) binding site as being largely responsible for the complex stabilization. The influence of the individual components is very well reflected by the previously published crystal structure of the human Rad50 zinc hook (PDB: 5GOX). In addition, we hereby report the effect of phosphorylation of the zinc hook domain, which exerts a destabilizing effect on the domain. This study identifies factors governing the stability of metal-mediated protein–protein interactions and illuminates their molecular basis.},

abstract = {In a recent sequence-analysis study it was concluded that up to 10{\%} of the human proteome could be comprised of zinc proteins, quite varied in the functional spread. The native structures of only few of the proteins are actually established. The elucidation of rest of the sequences of not just human but even other actively investigated genomes may benefit from knowledge of the structural consensus of the zinc-binding centers of the currently known zinc proteins. Nearly four hundred X-ray and NMR structures in the database of zinc-protein structures available as of April 2007 were investigated for geometry and conformation in the zinc-binding centers; separately for the structural and catalytic proteins and individually in the zinc centers coordinated to three and four amino-acid ligands. Enhanced cysteine involvement in agreement with the observation in human proteome has been detected in contrast with previous reports. Deviations from ideal coordination geometries are detected, possible underlying reasons are investigated, and correlations of geometry and conformation in zinc-coordination centers with protein function are established, providing possible benchmarks for putative zinc-binding patterns of the burgeoning genome data. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.
