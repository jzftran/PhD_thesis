abstract = {Period (PER) proteins are essential components of the mammalian circadian clock. They form complexes with cryptochromes (CRY), which negatively regulate CLOCK/BMAL1-dependent transactivation of clock and clock-controlled genes. To define the roles of mammalian CRY/PER complexes in the circadian clock, we have determined the crystal structure of a complex comprising the photolyase homology region of mouse CRY1 (mCRY1) and a C-terminal mouse PER2 (mPER2) fragment. mPER2 winds around the helical mCRY1 domain covering the binding sites of FBXL3 and CLOCK/BMAL1, but not the FAD binding pocket. Our structure revealed an unexpected zinc ion in one interface, which stabilizes mCRY1-mPER2 interactions in vivo. We provide evidence that mCRY1/mPER2 complex formation is modulated by an interplay of zinc binding and mCRY1 disulfide bond formation, which may be influenced by the redox state of the cell. Our studies may allow for the development of circadian and metabolic modulators. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Metal ions are essential elements present in biological systems able to facilitate many cellular processes including proliferation, signaling, DNA synthesis and repair. Zinc ion (Zn(II)) is an important cofactor for numerous biochemical reactions. Commonly, structural zinc sites demonstrate high Zn(II) affinity and compact architecture required for sequence-specific macromolecule binding. However, how Zn(II)-dependent proteins fold, how their dissociation occurs, and which factors modulate zinc protein affinity as well as stability remains not fully understood. The molecular rules governing precise regulation of zinc proteins function are hidden in the relationship between sequence and structure, and hence require deep understanding of their folding mechanism under metal load, reactivity and metal-to-protein affinity. Even though, this sequence-structure relationship has an impact on zinc proteins function, it has been shown that other biological factors including cellular localization and Zn(II) availability influence overall protein behavior. Taking into account all of the mentioned factors, in this review, we aim to describe the relationship between structure-function-stability of zinc structural sites, found in a zinc finger, zinc hook and zinc clasps, and reach far beyond a structural point of view in order to appreciate the balance between chemistry and biology that govern the protein world.},

abstract = {Phage display is a powerful technique for profiling specificities of peptide binding domains. The method is suited for the identification of high-affinity ligands with inhibitor potential when using highly diverse combinatorial peptide phage libraries. Such experiments further provide consensus motifs for genome-wide scanning of ligands of potential biological relevance. A complementary but considerably less explored approach is to display expression products of genomic DNA, cDNA, open reading frames (ORFs), or oligonucleotide libraries designed to encode defined regions of a target proteome on phage particles. One of the main applications of such proteomic libraries has been the elucidation of antibody epitopes. This review is focused on the use of proteomic phage display to uncover protein-protein interactions of potential relevance for cellular function. The method is particularly suited for the discovery of interactions between peptide binding domains and their targets. We discuss the largely unexplored potential of this method in the discovery of domain-motif interactions of potential biological relevance.},

abstract = {The metal binding at protein–protein interfaces is still uncharted territory in intermolecular interactions. To date, only a few protein complexes binding Zn(II) in an intermolecular manner have been deeply investigated. The most notable example of such interfaces is located in the highly conserved Rad50 protein, part of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, where Zn(II) is required for homodimerization (Zn(Rad50)2). The high stability of Zn(Rad50)2 is conserved not only for the protein derived from the thermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (logK12 = 20.95 for 130-amino-acid-long fragment), which was the first one studied, but also for the human paralog studied here (logK12 = 19.52 for a 183-amino-acid-long fragment). As we reported previously, the extremely high stability results from the metal-coupled folding process where particular Rad50 protein fragments play a critical role. The sequence–structure–stability analysis based on human Rad50 presented here separates the individual structural components that increase the stability of the complex, pointing to amino acid residues far away from the Zn(II) binding site as being largely responsible for the complex stabilization. The influence of the individual components is very well reflected by the previously published crystal structure of the human Rad50 zinc hook (PDB: 5GOX). In addition, we hereby report the effect of phosphorylation of the zinc hook domain, which exerts a destabilizing effect on the domain. This study identifies factors governing the stability of metal-mediated protein–protein interactions and illuminates their molecular basis.},

@article{Fields1989,
abstract = {PROTEIN-protein interactions between two proteins have generally been studied using biochemical techniques such as crosslinking, co-immunoprecipitation and co-fractionation by chromatography. We have generated a novel genetic system to study these interactions by taking advantage of the properties of the GAL4 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein is a transcriptional activator required for the expression of genes encoding enzymes of galactose utilization. It consists of two separable and functionally essential domains: an N-terminal domain which binds to specific DNA sequences (UASG); and a C-terminal domain containing acidic regions, which is necessary to activate transcription. We have generated a system of two hybrid proteins containing parts of GAL4: the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to a protein 'X' and a GAL4 activating region fused to a protein 'Y'. If X and Y can form a protein-protein complex and reconstitute proximity of the GAL4 domains, tran-scription of a gene regulated by UASG occurs. We have tested this system using two yeast proteins that are known to interact-SNF1 and SNF4. High transcriptional activity is obtained only when both hybrids are present in a cell. This system may be applicable as a general method to identify proteins that interact with a known protein by the use of a simple galactose selection. {\textcopyright} 1989 Nature Publishing Group.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that dynamically changing Zn2+ affects numerous cellular processes, including protein–protein communication and protein complex assembly. How Zn2+-involved protein–protein interactions (ZPPIs) are formed and dissociate and how their stability and reactivity are driven in a zinc interactome remain poorly understood, mostly due to experimental obstacles. Here, we review recent research advances on the role of Zn2+ in the formation of interprotein sites, their architecture, function, and stability. Moreover, we underline the importance of zinc networks in intersystemic communication and highlight bioinformatic and experimental challenges required for the identification and investigation of ZPPIs.},

abstract = {Proteins effect a number of biological functions, from cellular signaling, organization, mobility, and transport to catalyzing biochemical reactions and coordinating an immune response. These varied functions are often dependent upon macromolecular interactions, particularly with other proteins. Small-scale studies in the scientific literature report protein–protein interactions (PPIs), but slowly and with bias towards well-studied proteins. In an era where genomic sequence is readily available, deducing genotype–phenotype relationships requires an understanding of protein connectivity at proteome-scale. A proteome-scale map of the protein–protein interaction network provides a global view of cellular organization and function. Here, we discuss a summary of methods for building proteome-scale interactome maps and the current status and implications of mapping achievements. Not only do interactome maps serve as a reference, detailing global cellular function and organization patterns, but they can also reveal the mechanisms altered by disease alleles, highlight the patterns of interaction rewiring across evolution, and help pinpoint biologically and therapeutically relevant proteins. Despite the considerable strides made in proteome-wide mapping, several technical challenges persist. Therefore, future considerations that impact current mapping efforts are also discussed.},

abstract = {Genome-wide studies are providing researchers with a potentially complete list of the molecular components present In living systems. It is now evident that several metal ions are essential to life and that metalloproteins, that is, proteins that require a metal ion to perform their physiological function, are widespread in all organisms. However, there is currently a lack of well-established experimental methods aimed at analyzing the complete set of metalloproteins encoded by an organism (the metalloproteome). This information is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the whole of the processes occurring in living systems. Predictive tools must thus be applied to define metalloproteomes. In this Account, we discuss the current progress in the development of bioinformatics methods for the prediction, based solely on protein sequences, of metalloproteins. With these methods, it is possible to scan entire proteomes for metalloproteins, such as zinc proteins or copper proteins, which are identified by the presence of specific metal-binding sites, metal-binding domains, or both. The predicted metalloproteins can be then analyzed to obtain information on their function and evolution. For example, the comparative analysis of the content and usage of different metalloproteins across living organisms can be used to obtain hints on the evolution of metalloproteomes. As case studies, we predicted the content of zinc, nonheme iron, and copper-proteins in a representative set of organisms taken from the three domains of life. The zinc proteome represents about 9{\%} of the entire proteome in eukaryotes, but it ranges from 5{\%} to 6{\%} in prokaryotes, therefore indicating a substantial increase of the number of zinc proteins in higher organisms. In contrast, the number of nonheme iron proteins is relatively constant in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and therefore their relative share diminishes in passing from archaea (about 7{\%}), to bacteria (about 4{\%}), to eukaryotes (about 1{\%}). Copper proteins represent less than 1{\%} of the proteomes in all the organisms studied. We also discuss the limits of these methods, the approaches used to overcome some of these limits to improve our predictions, and possible future developments in the field of bioinformatics-based investigation of metalloproteins. As a longstanding goal of the biological sciences, the understanding of life at the systems level, or systems biology, is experiencing a rekindling of interest; ready access to complete information on metalloproteomes is crucial to correctly represent the role of metal ions in living organisms. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

This work was performed using a number of available predicted zinc proteomes of various representative organisms, leading to the almost complete annotation of, among others, the predicted human zinc proteome. The computational tools exploited included sequence-based and, when possible, structure-based functional predictions. We assigned a hypothetical function to 74{\%} of the 1,472 sequences analyzed that lacked annotation in the starting dataset. We also added new functional categories, not described in the reference dataset, such as ubiquitin binding and DNA replication. As a general conclusion, we can state that the quality of each functional prediction parallels the amount of information for the sequence analyzed: the larger the amount of information, the more detailed and reliable is the proposed functional prediction.
