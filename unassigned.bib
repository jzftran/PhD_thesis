abstract = {Proteins effect a number of biological functions, from cellular signaling, organization, mobility, and transport to catalyzing biochemical reactions and coordinating an immune response. These varied functions are often dependent upon macromolecular interactions, particularly with other proteins. Small-scale studies in the scientific literature report protein–protein interactions (PPIs), but slowly and with bias towards well-studied proteins. In an era where genomic sequence is readily available, deducing genotype–phenotype relationships requires an understanding of protein connectivity at proteome-scale. A proteome-scale map of the protein–protein interaction network provides a global view of cellular organization and function. Here, we discuss a summary of methods for building proteome-scale interactome maps and the current status and implications of mapping achievements. Not only do interactome maps serve as a reference, detailing global cellular function and organization patterns, but they can also reveal the mechanisms altered by disease alleles, highlight the patterns of interaction rewiring across evolution, and help pinpoint biologically and therapeutically relevant proteins. Despite the considerable strides made in proteome-wide mapping, several technical challenges persist. Therefore, future considerations that impact current mapping efforts are also discussed.},

@article{Fields1989,
abstract = {PROTEIN-protein interactions between two proteins have generally been studied using biochemical techniques such as crosslinking, co-immunoprecipitation and co-fractionation by chromatography. We have generated a novel genetic system to study these interactions by taking advantage of the properties of the GAL4 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein is a transcriptional activator required for the expression of genes encoding enzymes of galactose utilization. It consists of two separable and functionally essential domains: an N-terminal domain which binds to specific DNA sequences (UASG); and a C-terminal domain containing acidic regions, which is necessary to activate transcription. We have generated a system of two hybrid proteins containing parts of GAL4: the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to a protein 'X' and a GAL4 activating region fused to a protein 'Y'. If X and Y can form a protein-protein complex and reconstitute proximity of the GAL4 domains, tran-scription of a gene regulated by UASG occurs. We have tested this system using two yeast proteins that are known to interact-SNF1 and SNF4. High transcriptional activity is obtained only when both hybrids are present in a cell. This system may be applicable as a general method to identify proteins that interact with a known protein by the use of a simple galactose selection. {\textcopyright} 1989 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Boder1997,
abstract = {Display on the yeast cell wall is well suited for engineering mammalian cell-surface and secreted proteins (e.g., antibodies, receptors, cytokines) that require endoplasmic reticulum-specific post-translational processing for efficient folding and activity. C-terminal fusion to the Aga2p mating adhesion niceptor of Saccharomyces cerevis/ae has been used for the selection of scfv antibody fragments with threefold decreased antigen dissoci-ation rate from a randomly mutated library. A eukaryotic host should alleviate expression biases present in bacterially propagated combinatorial libraries. Quantitative flow cytometric analysis enables fine discrimination of kinetic parameters for protein binding to soluble ligands.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are central to understanding the functional relationships between proteins. Over the past three decades, the number of protein-protein interactions identified has increased significantly. As a result, a large number of databases have been created to catalog and annotate these interactions. This article gives an overview of the existing protein-protein interaction databases. It introduces the common terminology used in the interaction databases and describes their features, the strategies they use to curate and assess interactions, and highlights their differences. Some of the community standards defined to deal with data compatibility across databases are also described.},
